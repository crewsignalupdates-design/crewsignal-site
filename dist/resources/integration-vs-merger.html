    <p>Airline partnerships often generate headlines about “mergers,” “alliances,” and “integrations,” yet these terms describe very different legal and operational realities. This brief explainer clarifies the distinction and outlines how the
       <a href="https://nmb.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>National Mediation Board (NMB)</strong></a>
       evaluates when two carriers effectively operate as one for labor-representation purposes.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>🔹 What Is an Integration?</h2>
    <p>An <strong>integration</strong> occurs when two airlines coordinate certain aspects of their operations without changing corporate ownership. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reciprocal frequent-flyer or loyalty-program benefits</li>
      <li>Shared airport facilities, gates, or terminals</li>
      <li>Joint scheduling systems or interline booking</li>
      <li>Marketing alliances and reciprocal flight codes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Integrations are designed to improve efficiency and connectivity but leave each company legally distinct. They may still require review by the
       <strong>Department of Transportation (DOT)</strong> or
       <strong>Department of Justice (DOJ)</strong> if the collaboration affects competition or market access.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🔹 What Is a Merger?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>merger</strong> is a formal corporate transaction in which one airline combines with another through the exchange of stock, assets, and management control. Following regulatory clearance, a single entity remains.</p>
    <p>Mergers are typically disclosed through <strong>SEC filings</strong> such as 8-K reports or proxy statements and undergo antitrust review by the
       <strong>DOJ Antitrust Division</strong> and DOT to ensure fair competition and consumer protection.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🔹 What Triggers a Single-Carrier Determination?</h2>
    <p>Under the <strong>Railway Labor Act (RLA)</strong>, the NMB may determine that two or more carriers operate as a <em>single transportation system</em> even when no legal merger has occurred.
       The Board looks at the <em>functional reality</em> of how the airlines operate day-to-day. Common factors include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unified management or common officers directing labor relations</li>
      <li>Shared payroll, personnel, or benefits administration</li>
      <li>Integrated scheduling, dispatch, or crew-assignment systems</li>
      <li>Joint branding, marketing, or route coordination suggesting a single operation</li>
      <li>Centralized control of key business or safety functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When these elements show that employees effectively work within one system, the NMB can issue a <strong>Single-Carrier Determination</strong>.
       Such a decision consolidates labor-representation coverage across the combined system.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🔹 Why a Single-Carrier Finding Matters</h2>
    <p>Although uncommon, the NMB can issue a single-carrier finding <em>without a formal merger</em>.
       This triggers important procedural questions under the RLA:
       which union, if any, represents the newly combined group of employees,
       and whether a new election should be conducted.</p>
    <p>The process is entirely separate from corporate or antitrust law—it concerns
       <strong>representation rights</strong>, not business structure. Understanding this distinction helps aviation professionals interpret partnership and integration news with greater accuracy.</p>
