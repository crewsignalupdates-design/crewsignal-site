  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <li><strong>Netlify Inc.</strong> — website hosting and analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Intuit Mailchimp</strong> — email marketing platform managing subscriber lists and mailings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers act as data processors and are bound by privacy and security obligations. Data may be stored in the United States or other jurisdictions where these companies operate.</p>

  <h2>5. Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>For visitors in the EU / UK, we rely on your <strong>consent</strong> to send newsletters and our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> to maintain site security. You may withdraw consent at any time by unsubscribing.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We keep subscriber information while you remain subscribed. Emails and correspondence are deleted once resolved or no longer required by law.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>The site uses HTTPS encryption and industry-standard security controls through Netlify and Mailchimp. However, no system can guarantee absolute security, and you provide information at your own discretion.</p>
