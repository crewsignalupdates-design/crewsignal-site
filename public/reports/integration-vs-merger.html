    <h2>Quick Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Integration / Alliance:</strong> Coordination of selected operations or programs (e.g., codeshare, reciprocal loyalty earn/burn, limited schedule coordination, lounge reciprocity). Each carrier remains a separate corporate entity with its own operating certificate, workforce, and collective-bargaining agreements.</p>
    <p><strong>Merger:</strong> Two companies combine into a single corporate entity. Over time this yields one operating certificate, unified branding, and—after the applicable statutory steps—joint labor agreements and integrated seniority lists.</p>

      <strong>What integration is (and isn’t):</strong> Integration improves interoperability and customer convenience, but it does <em>not</em> change the employer of record, union representation, contracts, or seniority lists. Those outcomes arise only from a corporate merger followed by NMB processes and bargaining.

  <section id="nmb-overview">
    <h2>National Mediation Board: Brief History & Role</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.nmb.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Mediation Board (NMB)</a> is an independent federal agency established by the <em>1934 amendments</em> to the Railway Labor Act (RLA). It facilitates labor-management relations in the railroad and airline industries by mediating disputes, conducting representation elections, and determining when carriers operate as a “single transportation system” (often called “single-carrier” status) for representation purposes. See the NMB’s <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/index.php/mission-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mission &amp; Organization</a> page for an official overview.</p>
    <p>Under the RLA framework (1926; amended 1934, 1966), the NMB’s “single transportation system” determinations are a key trigger: once two carriers are found to be a single system for a given <em>craft or class</em>, representation can be extended, terminated, or put to an election, and the combined group typically proceeds toward joint bargaining.</p>

  <section id="without-merger">
    <h2>Single-Carrier Determinations <em>Without</em> a Formal Merger</h2>
    <p>While mergers commonly lead to single-carrier findings, the NMB can make this determination <em>absent a statutory merger</em> if labor relations and control have, in substance, been integrated. The Board looks for substantial integration of operations, financial control, and labor/personnel functions (see standards summarized in <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39n002.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">39&nbsp;NMB&nbsp;2</a> and <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35n019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35&nbsp;NMB&nbsp;19</a>).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Holding-company subsidiaries</strong> — The Board has found single-carrier status among subsidiaries where management and labor control were centralized even with separate corporate charters or FAA certificates. Example: regional consolidation under a single parent (e.g., Pinnacle/Mesaba/Colgan for Flight Attendants: <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39n035.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">39&nbsp;NMB&nbsp;327 (2012)</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>American Eagle / “brand” systems</strong> — NMB annual reports in the early 1990s reference consolidated American Eagle proceedings, reflecting how common control/brand operations can lead to single-system treatment even across technically separate companies (see <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1991-1992-Annual-Reports.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1991–1992 NMB Annual Reports</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>When integration is <em>insufficient</em></strong> — The Board has also rejected single-carrier status where common ownership existed but labor relations and operations remained distinct (e.g., <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40n012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Airways / North American, 40&nbsp;NMB&nbsp;29 (2012)</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="callout small">
      <strong>Bottom line:</strong> A corporate merger is <em>not</em> required for a single-carrier finding. The NMB focuses on substance over form—common management, centralized labor relations, and integrated operations can be enough.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="craft-class">
    <h2>Why Findings Are Craft-by-Craft</h2>
    <p>Under the Railway Labor Act, representation and bargaining are organized by <em>craft or class</em> (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, passenger service, dispatch, etc.). Each has its own union certification and contract. Accordingly, the NMB evaluates single-carrier status <em>for each group separately</em>, often on different timelines, depending on how integrated that group’s operations and labor relations are.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example—Southwest/AirTran (Pilots only):</strong> The NMB certified SWAPA for the combined pilots’ craft/class while other groups followed separate tracks and timing (<a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/41-NMB-No.-61-CORRECTED-VERSION-Findings-Upon-Investigation-Determination-of-Certification-Southwest-Airlines-SWAPA-ALPA.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">41&nbsp;NMB&nbsp;No.&nbsp;61</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Example—Delta/Northwest (Pilots first; others later):</strong> Pilot integration and common control supported an early pilots’ finding (e.g., <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/36n021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36&nbsp;NMB&nbsp;21</a>). Other crafts/classes were addressed in subsequent proceedings as their integration matured.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="takeaways">
    <h2>Key Take-aways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Integration ≠ merger.</strong> Integrations improve connectivity and customer benefits without changing employers, representation, or seniority lists.</li>
      <li><strong>Mergers add legal and labor steps.</strong> After a merger, NMB single-carrier determinations (by craft/class) often trigger representation changes and joint bargaining.</li>
      <li><strong>No merger necessary.</strong> The NMB can find a single transportation system without a formal merger if control and labor relations are centralized.</li>
      <li><strong>Craft-by-craft.</strong> Because the RLA organizes representation by craft/class, NMB findings and elections occur group-by-group, not all at once.</li>
