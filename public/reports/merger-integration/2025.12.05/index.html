    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
    company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
    crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
    or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
    carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
    and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
    consolidation signals.

<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    U.S. airline merger and integration activity remained relatively quiet entering December, but several active
    structures continue to define the landscape for crew and labor-focused readers: closed-deal integration at
    Alaska–Hawaiian, a commercial partnership track at United–JetBlue (“Blue Sky”), and continued aftershocks in the
    ULCC space following the terminated JetBlue–Spirit transaction.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The through-line is execution risk. Closed deals and major partnerships can still encounter meaningful operational
    and labor gating events — seniority integration, JCBA sequencing, certificate/system convergence, and reliability
    during schedule peaks — that shape how “integration” is experienced on the line.
  </p>

    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Integration watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Partnership creep:</strong> Whether “Blue Sky” expands beyond loyalty/interline into deeper coordination that could invite DOJ or NMB scrutiny.</li>
      <li><strong>Closed-deal labor integration:</strong> Seniority verification, JCBA sequencing, and committee posture at Alaska–Hawaiian.</li>
      <li><strong>ULCC stress:</strong> How restructuring and capacity changes translate into reliability risk and labor leverage.</li>

<!-- Section 2: Core Tracks -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” Partnership:</strong> United and JetBlue’s “Blue Sky” collaboration remains a commercial partnership
    centered on loyalty integration and interline booking. MileagePlus and TrueBlue members can earn and redeem across both networks,
    and each carrier sells the other’s flights through its own channels.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    At this stage, Blue Sky is customer-facing and commercial (loyalty, selling, interline). It is not an operational merger
    or joint venture with combined crews, and it is not accompanied by joint labor negotiations, shared operational control, or
    unified safety/maintenance systems. From a representation standpoint, current activity does not meet single-carrier criteria.
    CrewSignal will continue to track any expansion in scope that could eventually have NMB or DOJ implications.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Spirit–JetBlue Fallout (context):</strong> The proposed JetBlue–Spirit merger was terminated in March 2024 after DOJ litigation
    and an adverse court ruling. For December 2025, this remains relevant mainly as a regulatory benchmark demonstrating current DOJ
    resistance to mid-tier consolidation, and as a driver of continued financial and strategic pressure in the ULCC space.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Alaska–Hawaiian (closed deal &amp; labor integration):</strong> Alaska Air Group’s acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines is fully closed.
    Integration work is progressing across reservations, loyalty, and operations, including a combined loyalty program and a single FAA
    operating certificate as of late 2025.
  </p>

  <div class="cs-report__callout cs-report__callout--neutral">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Crew Signal integration read – 2025.12.05</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>United–JetBlue:</strong> Still a commercial partnership; monitor for scope expansion that changes the regulatory or representation lens.</li>
      <li><strong>Alaska–Hawaiian:</strong> Closed-deal integration continues; labor sequencing and seniority/JCBA posture remain the main gating risks.</li>
      <li><strong>ULCC / mid-tier:</strong> Post–Spirit/JetBlue precedent continues to shape consolidation expectations and strategic pressure.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<!-- Section 3: Tangential / Contextual Notes -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Tangential / Contextual Notes</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Flight Attendant integration (AFA–CWA):</strong> AFA’s Seniority Merger Integration Committee has mailed verification packets to
    nearly 10,000 Alaska and Hawaiian flight attendants, a key step toward a merged seniority list. Both pre-merger groups ratified
    updated contracts in 2025, and a joint AFA Joint Negotiating Committee (JNC) is working toward a unified JCBA with progress reported
    on several non-economic sections.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Pilot integration (ALPA):</strong> Alaska and Hawaiian pilots, both represented by ALPA, opened JCBA negotiations with Alaska management
    in early 2025 with the goal of establishing a single pilot agreement for the combined carrier.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Regionals &amp; ULCCs:</strong> No new mergers were announced at the ULCC or regional level. Spirit’s restructuring and financial pressure
    may create longer-term vulnerability, while Frontier, Allegiant, and Sun Country remain potential consolidators or beneficiaries of any
    capacity exits depending on market conditions and regulatory appetite.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>International (labor-relevant only):</strong> Korean Air–Asiana integration continues with publicly reported concerns about wage gaps,
    seniority harmonization, and cultural integration. Lufthansa’s 41% stake in ITA Airways (with a path to full control) brings ITA further into
    the Lufthansa Group structure and will eventually require harmonization of pay, work rules, and seniority within the group framework.
  </p>
