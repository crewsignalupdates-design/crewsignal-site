    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
    company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
    crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
    or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
    carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
    and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
    consolidation signals.

  <!-- 1. Industry Overview -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">1. Industry Overview</h2>
    <p>
      U.S. airline merger and integration activity remains relatively quiet entering December, but several active
      structures define the landscape:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        <strong>Alaska–Hawaiian:</strong>
        The acquisition closed on September 18, 2024 following DOT approval with conditions, creating a combined
        West Coast–Hawaii-focused carrier now progressing through operational, loyalty, and labor integration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” Partnership:</strong>
        A loyalty and interline collaboration enabling reciprocal earning and redemption across MileagePlus and TrueBlue,
        and cross-platform selling of each airline’s flights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spirit–JetBlue:</strong>
        The terminated merger remains a key regulatory precedent shaping DOJ skepticism toward mid-tier consolidation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legacy carriers (Delta, American, United):</strong>
        Strategy is focused on internal optimization, fleet commitments, and earnings recovery rather than new merger
        announcements.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 2. United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">2. United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” Partnership</h2>
    <p>
      United and JetBlue’s “Blue Sky” collaboration remains a commercial partnership centered on loyalty integration
      and interline booking. MileagePlus and TrueBlue members can earn and redeem across both networks, and each carrier
      sells the other’s flights through its own channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage, Blue Sky is:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Customer-facing and commercial (loyalty, selling, interline);</li>
      <li>Not an operational merger or joint venture with combined crews;</li>
      <li>Not accompanied by joint labor negotiations, shared operational control, or unified safety/maintenance systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      From a representation standpoint, current activity does not meet single-carrier criteria. CrewSignal will
      continue to track any expansion in scope that could eventually have NMB or DOJ implications.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3. Spirit–JetBlue Fallout -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">3. Spirit–JetBlue Fallout (Context Only)</h2>
    <p>
      The proposed JetBlue–Spirit merger was terminated in March 2024 after DOJ litigation and an adverse court ruling.
      JetBlue has since pivoted toward standalone survival and partnership strategies, including Blue Sky, while managing
      route cuts and aircraft delivery deferrals. Spirit has moved into deeper financial distress, including Chapter 11
      restructuring and capacity reductions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For December 2025, this is relevant mainly as a regulatory benchmark demonstrating current DOJ resistance
      to mid-tier consolidation, and as a driver of continued financial and strategic pressure in the ULCC space.
    </p>

  <!-- 4. Alaska–Hawaiian -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">4. Alaska–Hawaiian Merger: Closed Deal &amp; Labor Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Alaska Air Group’s acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines is fully closed. Integration work is progressing across
      reservations, loyalty, and operations, including a combined loyalty program and a single FAA operating certificate
      as of late 2025.
    </p>

    <h3 class="cs-report__subheading">Flight Attendant Integration (AFA–CWA)</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        AFA’s Seniority Merger Integration Committee has mailed verification packets to nearly 10,000 Alaska and
        Hawaiian flight attendants, a key step toward a merged seniority list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Both pre-merger groups ratified updated contracts in 2025, providing a platform for joint negotiations.
      </li>
      <li>
        A joint AFA Joint Negotiating Committee (JNC) is now working toward a unified JCBA, with progress reported
        on several non-economic sections.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="cs-report__subheading">Pilot Integration (ALPA)</h3>
    <p>
      Alaska and Hawaiian pilots, both represented by ALPA, opened JCBA negotiations with Alaska management in early 2025
      with the goal of establishing a single pilot agreement for the combined carrier.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. Regionals & ULCCs -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">5. Regionals &amp; ULCCs</h2>
    <p>
      No new mergers have been announced at the ULCC or regional level. Spirit’s restructuring and financial pressure
      may create longer-term vulnerability, while Frontier, Allegiant, and Sun Country remain potential consolidators
      or beneficiaries of any capacity exits depending on market conditions and regulatory appetite.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 6. International -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">6. International (Labor-Relevant Only)</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        <strong>Korean Air–Asiana:</strong>
        Integration continues with publicly reported concerns about wage gaps, seniority harmonization, and cultural
        integration, all of which have significant labor implications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lufthansa–ITA Airways:</strong>
        Lufthansa’s 41% stake in ITA Airways, with a path to full control, brings ITA further into the Lufthansa Group
        structure and will eventually require harmonization of pay, work rules, and seniority within the group framework.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 7. Outlook -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">7. Weekly Outlook</h2>
    <p>
      For the coming week, CrewSignal will monitor:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Any expansion of the United–JetBlue Blue Sky partnership beyond loyalty and interline;</li>
      <li>Further AFA JNC news and seniority integration milestones at Alaska–Hawaiian;</li>
      <li>Financial and strategic developments at Spirit and JetBlue;</li>
      <li>Labor harmonization signals within Korean Air–Asiana and Lufthansa–ITA.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Coverage will continue on a weekly cadence, with each report feeding into the broader Merger &amp; Integration
      Hub frameworks on representation, single-carrier determinations, and majority absorption.
