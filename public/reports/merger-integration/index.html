<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>
JetBlue and United announced the <strong>Blue Sky</strong> collaboration on May 29, 
positioning it as a loyalty, slot-access, and operations-coordination partnership—not a corporate merger. 
DOT completed its review on July 29, permitting implementation. 
Key integration signals include reciprocal frequent-flyer earn/burn (expected Fall 2025), 
interline expansion, and a JFK↔EWR slot/timing exchange (JFK access for United beginning 2027).
</p>

<p>
Both carriers publicly deny any merger plan, but the scope of coordination warrants continued monitoring. 
Labor remains a gating factor: United Flight Attendants rejected a mediated TA on July 30, triggering an 
internal reprioritization process. No DOJ merger or antitrust filing is on record as of this report.

<h3>Integration vs. Merger — Why It Matters</h3>

<p>
Blue Sky qualifies as <strong>integration</strong>: loyalty reciprocity, interline expansion, operational 
coordination, and limited schedule adjustments. These actions <em>do not</em> merge corporate entities, 
operating certificates, or seniority lists.
</p>

<p>
A <strong>merger</strong> would require DOJ antitrust review, NMB single-carrier proceedings, and negotiation 
of joint labor agreements. Given JetBlue’s blocked acquisition of Spirit, antitrust sensitivity remains high.

<h3>Integration Signals to Watch</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loyalty</strong>: TrueBlue ↔ MileagePlus earn/burn activation (Fall 2025 target).</li>
<li><strong>Slots</strong>: United receives up to 7 daily JFK round-trip slots starting 2027; JetBlue 
receives 8 timing positions at EWR.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Plumbing</strong>: Interline/cross-booking build-out across apps and web 
platforms.</li>

<!-- UPDATED LABOR SECTION -->
<section id="labor">
<h3>Labor Context — United Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA)</h3>

<h4>TA Rejection (July 30, 2025)</h4>
<p>
United Flight Attendants voted <strong>71% to reject</strong> a mediated Tentative Agreement, with over 
<strong>92% turnout</strong>. AFA emphasized that the proposal did not meet members’ expectations on compensation, 
scheduling, or quality-of-life improvements.
</p>

<p>
Because the TA was reached <strong>during federal mediation</strong>, the parties remain in the NMB mediation 
framework. A rejection does <em>not</em> reopen direct bargaining; only the NMB can alter mediation status.
</p>

<h4>Post-Vote Survey (Aug 19–Sep 3)</h4>
<p>
To prepare for the next mediated session, the AFA United MEC conducted a structured membership survey:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Opened: <strong>August 19, 2025</strong></li>
<li>Closed: <strong>September 3, 2025</strong></li>
<li>Anonymous and confidential</li>
<li>Included written responses</li>
<li>Evaluated economic, scheduling, reserve, and quality-of-life priorities</li>
</ul>

<p>
As of November 7, AFA has <strong>not published numerical results</strong>. The MEC states only that member feedback 
will shape the next bargaining package and define AFA’s position when mediation resumes.
</p>

<h4>Late-October Discussions (Outside Mediation)</h4>
<p>
In late October, United and AFA engaged in at least one round of <strong>issue-focused discussions without the 
mediator present</strong>. These were clarifying conversations rather than formal bargaining and are permissible under 
the Railway Labor Act as long as mediation status remains unchanged.
</p>

<p>
As of this report’s cutoff date (<strong>Nov 7, 2025</strong>), <strong>no new mediated sessions were scheduled</strong> and 
no revised tentative agreement framework had emerged.
</p>

<section id="labor-integration-impact">
<h3>Labor Implications for Blue Sky Integration</h3>

<p>
Labor stability at United remains a <strong>moderating factor</strong> for Blue Sky’s operational roll-out.
Staffing grids, reserve rules, and scheduling flexibility influence the reliability of cross-booking, 
day-of-operations coordination, and potential schedule harmonization at hubs like EWR, JFK, and BOS.
</p>

<p>
The post-vote survey and October discussions indicate constructive engagement, but until mediation resumes 
with a revised proposal, United’s labor climate remains <strong>stable but unresolved</strong>, which may affect the 
pace of certain integration elements through late 2025 and early 2026.

<h3>Regulatory Context</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>DOT</strong>: Completed review July 29; no objections filed.</li>
<li><strong>DOJ</strong>: No public merger filing for UA+B6 as of Nov 7.</li>
<li><strong>Spirit (3rd-party)</strong>: Filed objections June 24 citing competitive harm at constrained airports.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section id="ytd-assessment">
<h3>YTD Assessment</h3>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> Blue Sky has cleared DOT and entered phased implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> Loyalty and slot coordination increase functional integration; antitrust risk remains 
if scope expands.</p>
<p><strong>Outlook:</strong> Expect visible loyalty integration in Fall 2025; schedule coordination into 2026; 
JFK slot access begins 2027.</p>

<section id="milestones">
<h3>Upcoming Milestones / Watch-Points</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fall 2025</strong> — Loyalty earn/burn activation.</li>
<li><strong>Q4 2025–Q1 2026</strong> — Interline and cross-booking UX updates.</li>
<li><strong>2026</strong> — Additional schedule coordination at EWR/JFK possible.</li>
<li><strong>2027</strong> — United receives JFK slot package.</li>
<li><strong>Labor</strong> — Next mediated session pending NMB scheduling.</li>
