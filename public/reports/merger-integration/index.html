  <h3 class="cs-report__subheading">Representational Concepts (NMB Framework)</h3>

  <div class="cs-report__glossary">
    <p>
      <strong>Majority absorption</strong> occurs when, in a merger or single-carrier context,
      the National Mediation Board (NMB) determines that one union represents
      more than 50% of the combined craft or class. If no competing claim is filed,
      the NMB may certify that union as the representative of the entire combined
      workforce without an election. Majority absorption can materially affect
      seniority integration processes, the collective bargaining environment, and
      the eventual scope and character of a merged contract.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Showing of Interest (SOI)</strong> is the formal demonstration—usually via signed
      authorization cards—that a significant portion of the craft or class wishes to be
      represented by a different union than the one that would otherwise obtain representation
      through majority absorption. The NMB generally requires at least 35% SOI to trigger an
      investigation or election. A timely SOI can block or delay automatic majority absorption,
      shifting the representation outcome from an automatic certification to a contested
      process under NMB supervision.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a single-carrier determination, majority absorption or an election resolves
      which union is certified as representative of the combined group. Joint contract
      negotiations do not begin immediately at that point. The certified union must first
      establish merged governance structures, complete or verify a merged seniority list
      under its own merger policy, and develop unified bargaining goals. Only after those
      internal steps, and with the National Mediation Board’s involvement where required,
      do joint negotiations toward a single, merged contract for the craft or class actually begin—typically
      months, not days, after a single-carrier determination.

    <p>
      The Blue Sky collaboration between United and JetBlue remains an integration-focused partnership centered on
      loyalty reciprocity, slot and timing coordination at JFK and EWR, and selective operational alignment. As of
      the latest reporting period (through 2025.11.28), there have been
      <strong>no new structural merger filings, corporate combination announcements, or antitrust actions</strong>
      related to Blue Sky beyond the implementation milestones captured in the 2025 year-to-date analyses.

      Crew Signal continues to monitor for:

      <li>Any shift from integration language (“collaboration”, “partnership”) toward formal merger terminology;</li>
      <li>Changes in labor posture or NMB activity that might hint at representation or single-carrier implications;</li>
      <li>Operational behavior at JFK/EWR that suggests deeper co-planning or network consolidation;</li>
      <li>Regulatory activity, especially from DOJ or DOT, tied to slot concentration or competitive effects in shared markets.</li>
