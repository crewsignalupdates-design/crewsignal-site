    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
    company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
    crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
    or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
    carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
    and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
    consolidation signals.

<!-- Section 1: Headline Transaction -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The week ending 2025.12.12 reflected a pause across the U.S. airline merger and integration landscape,
    with no new structural transactions announced and no material public regulatory filings identified in the
    primary M&amp;I watchlist. Previously identified transactions and partnerships remained in place without
    visible escalation, modification, or discrete integration milestones.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Quiet weeks remain consequential for timeline integrity: internal planning, sequencing decisions, and labor
    posture can shift without public visibility, and later inflection points can appear “inevitable” in hindsight.
    CrewSignal continues weekly publication to preserve continuity and reduce hindsight bias when the next
    docketed or operational milestone emerges.
  </p>

  <div class="cs-report__callout">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Integration watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Regulatory engagement:</strong> Any new docket activity or public signals indicating timeline or condition changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution posture:</strong> Movement from planning to operational sequencing (systems, scheduling, fleet, or branding indicators).</li>
      <li><strong>Labor stability:</strong> Bargaining or scheduling pressure that could convert integration planning into reliability risk.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Section 2: Findings -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    No publicly observable merger or integration developments were identified during the reporting period.
    United–JetBlue, Alaska–Hawaiian, and ULCC monitoring tracks remained unchanged, with no new filings,
    announcements, or labor-facing actions disclosed.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    In continuity windows, CrewSignal treats the absence of new public filings as a data point rather than a conclusion:
    integration risk and representation triggers can move on clocks that do not align with the public-news cycle.
  </p>

  <div class="cs-report__callout cs-report__callout--neutral">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Crew Signal integration read – 2025.12.12</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Deal flow:</strong> No new structural transactions or milestones identified in the primary watchlist during this window.</li>
      <li><strong>Alaska–Hawaiian:</strong> Continued positioning phase; execution and representation-level inflection points remain ahead.</li>
      <li><strong>System-wide:</strong> Labor posture and scheduling stability remain leading indicators for integration success as the calendar turns.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<!-- Section 3 -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Tangential / Contextual Notes</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Periods of inactivity remain an important part of the merger and integration record, particularly during late-year
    cycles when carriers and regulators often defer major announcements until the following quarter. These windows can
    still include internal integration sequencing decisions and labor posture shifts that only become visible later.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Section 4 -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What We’re Watching Next</h2>

  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li>Any regulatory engagement related to United–JetBlue beyond the current partnership framework.</li>
    <li>Movement from planning to execution in Alaska–Hawaiian integration tracks.</li>
    <li>Renewed consolidation signals among ULCC or mid-tier carriers entering 2026.</li>
    <li>Labor positioning that could intersect with integration risk in early 2026.</li>
