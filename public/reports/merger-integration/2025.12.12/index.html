      <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
      This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
      company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
      crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
      or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
      carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
      and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
      consolidation signals.

  <!-- Section 1 -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      The week ending 2025.12.12 reflected a pause across the U.S. airline merger and
      integration landscape, with no new structural transactions announced and no
      material regulatory filings disclosed. Previously identified transactions and
      partnerships remained in place without visible escalation, modification, or
      formal integration milestones.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      No publicly observable merger or integration developments were identified during
      the reporting period. United–JetBlue, Alaska–Hawaiian, and ULCC monitoring tracks
      remained unchanged, with no new filings, announcements, or labor-facing actions
      disclosed.
    </p>

  <!-- Section 3 -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Tangential / Contextual Notes</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Periods of inactivity remain an important part of the merger and integration
      record, particularly during late-year cycles when carriers and regulators often
      defer major announcements until the following quarter.
    </p>
