    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
    company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
    crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
    or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
    carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
    and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
    consolidation signals.

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The week ending 2025.12.26 was a holiday-window continuity week for U.S. airline deal headlines, but it was not
    a “no-news” week for integration risk. Post-close workstreams tend to accelerate when the news cycle slows:
    sequencing, labor alignment, and reliability pressure become the real indicators of whether a combined platform
    can execute the integration agenda without operational wobble.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The Republic–Mesa transaction is now past the closing headline and firmly in the execution phase. In parallel,
    Alaska–Hawaiian remains a high-impact closed-deal integration track where single-operating-certificate milestones
    and JCBA / seniority processes define the lived timeline for crews. And “Blue Sky” remains a useful scope case study:
    a loyalty/interline collaboration can expand in practical impact without becoming an operational merger.

    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Integration watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Post-close execution:</strong> Whether combined platforms sustain reliability while aligning systems, staffing, and partner expectations.</li>
      <li><strong>Labor sequencing:</strong> JCBA posture, seniority process architecture, and base/equipment allocation decisions that can move faster than branding.</li>
      <li><strong>Scope creep vs. “partnership” framing:</strong> Loyalty + interline collaborations that incrementally deepen coordination without a formal merger structure.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Republic–Mesa (post-close phase):</strong> With the merger now completed, the public headline has passed and the integration agenda
    becomes the story. In this phase, the most consequential signals are not press releases — they’re whether the carrier can hold
    operational performance steady while aligning labor posture, regulatory milestones, and partner-facing service expectations.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Alaska–Hawaiian (closed deal; integration and labor gating):</strong> Alaska–Hawaiian continues to illustrate how integration success is gated by
    certificate milestones and contract work. Pilot-side updates have framed the single operating certificate milestone as a meaningful step,
    while JCBA negotiations remain the mechanism that ultimately determines unified rules, protections, and the path to a single pilot group.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” (commercial partnership lens):</strong> Blue Sky remains best understood as a consumer collaboration linking loyalty programs
    and enabling interline booking/selling across complementary networks. CrewSignal continues to treat it as a partnership track — not a combined operation —
    while watching for any expansion in scope that would change the regulatory or representation lens.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>International (labor-relevant only):</strong> The Korean Air–Asiana integration track continues to surface classic integration friction: pay systems,
    wage-gap harmonization, and mileage-program integration. These issues matter because they directly affect employee stability and customer trust —
    two variables that can constrain integration pace even after “deal close” is behind the market.

    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Crew Signal integration read – 2025.12.26</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Republic–Mesa:</strong> Post-close execution is the story; reliability + labor alignment are the highest-value signals.</li>
      <li><strong>Alaska–Hawaiian:</strong> Certificate/JCBA/seniority sequencing remains the gating mechanism for “combined carrier” reality on the line.</li>
      <li><strong>System-wide:</strong> Integration risk often presents first as staffing/scheduling strain — especially during peak travel windows.</li>

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What We’re Watching Next</h2>

  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li>Any Republic–Mesa integration sequencing signals that surface via operational performance, partner-facing metrics, or labor posture.</li>
    <li>Alaska–Hawaiian: further SOC-related operational milestones and publicly reported JCBA / seniority process signals.</li>
    <li>Any expansion of United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” beyond loyalty + interline into deeper coordination that changes the regulatory lens.</li>
    <li>International integration signals where wage/mileage harmonization becomes a pacing item (Korean Air–Asiana as a bellwether).</li>
