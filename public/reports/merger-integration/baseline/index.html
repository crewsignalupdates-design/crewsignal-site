          Deal architects mix and match features to balance regulatory risk, tax structures,

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Full statutory merger</strong> – two corporations combined into one surviving entity,
            typically aligned with a single certificate and a clear “combined airline” identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Holding company structures</strong> – a parent entity owns multiple certificates.
            Integration of operations and crews may lag the corporate combination, raising
            <a href="#section-single-carrier">single-carrier</a> and
            <a href="#section-scope">scope</a> questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asset transfers</strong> – gates, slots, aircraft, or routes move between carriers
            without a full corporate merger, often affecting crews through base and flying shifts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Joint ventures and alliances</strong> – can function like
            <a href="#section-integration">integration</a> in practice, with deeply coordinated

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Integration</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Integration</strong> is a loose term. Management may talk about “integrating”
          schedules, revenue management, brands, or networks long before there is a single legal
          merger or a single certificate. Integration can improve interoperability and customer convenience, but it does <em>not</em> change the
          employer of record, union representation, contracts, or seniority lists. Those outcomes arise only
          through representation processes and subsequent bargaining steps.
        </p>
        
          Integration language can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deep codeshares and aligned schedules;</li>
          <li>Shared branding, liveries, and marketing;</li>
          <li>Common management teams and joint planning;</li>
          <li>Transfers of flying between entities under common control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From a crew perspective, <a href="#section-integration">integration</a> without a clear
          <a href="#section-merger">merger</a> plan can feel like “merger consequences first, labor clarity later.”
          The airline may be presenting itself to the public and regulators as a unified network while
          leaving representation, <a href="#section-seniority">seniority</a>, and
          <a href="#section-scope">scope</a> questions unresolved.

      <!-- Merger -->
      <section id="section-merger" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Merger</h2>
        <p>
          In the classic sense, a <strong>merger</strong> is a statutory combination of two
          corporations into one. One entity survives; the other is folded into it. Assets,
          liabilities, and contracts are consolidated into a single corporate shell.
        </p>
        <p>
          In airline practice, a merger usually aligns with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A clear “surviving carrier” identity;
          </li>
          <li>
            Regulatory approvals from DOJ, DOT, and others;
          </li>
          <li>
            A path to a <a href="#section-single-carrier">single-carrier</a> finding at the NMB;
          </li>
          <li>
            A formal process for <a href="#section-seniority">seniority integration</a> and
            eventual <a href="#section-jcba">JCBA</a> bargaining.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For crews, a merger usually signals that management intends to move toward a single
          operating airline with unified branding, a combined seniority list, and one collective
          bargaining agreement for each craft or class.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Single-carrier -->
      <section id="section-single-carrier" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Single-carrier (NMB)</h2>
        <p>
          Under the Railway Labor Act, the National Mediation Board decides when two or more carriers
          have become a <strong>single transportation system</strong> for representation purposes.
          That determination is often referred to informally as a “single-carrier” finding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Board looks at factors such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Common management and control of labor relations;</li>
          <li>Integrated operations (dispatch, scheduling, maintenance control);</li>
          <li>Branding and public presentation as “one airline”;</li>
          <li>Financial and operational interdependence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For crews, the single-carrier question is central because it controls when separate
          bargaining units may be combined, when representation questions are asked, and when
          groups move toward a single <a href="#section-jcba">JCBA</a>. 
       <p>
          Single-carrier findings are often evaluated and implemented by <em>craft or class</em>. That matters because different workgroups can become operationally and managerially integrated on different timelines.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="section-single-carrier-without-merger" class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Single-carrier without a merger</h2>

  <p>
    A common misconception is that a statutory corporate merger is required before “single-carrier”
    consequences can become relevant to crews. In practice, representational pressure can arise when
    control and integration behaviors begin to resemble one system—especially in labor relations and
    the way work is created and assigned—even if management has not announced (or completed) a classic merger.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is most often associated with multi-certificate structures under common control, where the airline
    presents itself externally as a unified network but key labor structures remain separate internally.
  </p>

  <h3>What crews should watch</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Labor relations convergence:</strong> one set of policies/decision-makers handling discipline,
      training standards, inflight policies, base governance, or personnel administration across both operations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operational integration that affects work assignment:</strong> unified schedule design, coordinated banks,
      shared planning teams, or mixing pressures that change how flying is distributed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>“One airline” public posture:</strong> branding and messaging that imply a single system while representation
      and contracts remain separate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Representation signals:</strong> communications that explicitly reference “single transportation system,”
      “single-carrier,” or steps that would follow such a finding.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
      Once single-carrier questions become live, the representational path typically runs through
      <a href="#section-majority-absorption">majority absorption</a> and/or a
      <a href="#section-showing-of-interest">showing of interest</a> before the group moves toward a
      single <a href="#section-jcba">JCBA</a>.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>

<section id="section-craft-class-timing" class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Single-Carrier Timelines</h2>

  <p>
    Under the Railway Labor Act, representation and bargaining are organized by <em>craft or class</em>
    (flight attendants, pilots, mechanics, passenger service, dispatch, etc.). As a result, integration and
    representational questions can mature at different speeds for different groups.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Integration maturity differs by department:</strong> some functions centralize early (e.g., certain
      operational control or policy decision-making) while others remain separate until manuals, training,
      staffing models, and base structures are harmonized.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Labor relations may centralize unevenly:</strong> if one HR/labor team begins administering discipline,
      policies, or workplace rules across entities for one group before others, the representational “signal”
      for that group can appear earlier.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Operational mixing is not uniform:</strong> crews may remain operationally separated by base/fleet/flying
      patterns even while other groups are effectively blended through dispatch, planning, or shared control structures.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sequencing and filings:</strong> unions and carriers don’t always initiate representational action at the
      same time across all crafts/classes—timing can differ based on strategy and evidence of integration.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In practice, the representational question can arise when carriers under
    common control become integrated in substance—especially in labor relations and operational control—
    even if management has not completed a classic merger.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 1.25rem;">National Mediation Board Decisions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Holding-company subsidiaries:</strong>
      The NMB has found single transportation system status among affiliated carriers under common parent control
      where management and labor control became centralized. Example (Flight Attendants):
      <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/39n035.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Pinnacle / Mesaba / Colgan — 39 NMB No. 35 (2012)
      </a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Brand / “system” groupings:</strong>
      NMB annual reporting reflects that regional carrier groups doing business under a single brand (e.g., “American Eagle”)
      have been treated as single-system questions in representation discussions.
      See:
      <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1991-1992-Annual-Reports.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        1991–1992 NMB Annual Reports
      </a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>When integration is insufficient:</strong>
      The NMB has also rejected single-system treatment where ownership ties exist but labor relations and operations
      remain meaningfully separate. Example:
      <a href="https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/40n012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        World Airways / North American — 40 NMB No. 12 (2012) (dismissal)
      </a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <section class="cs-report__callout">
    <h3>Bottom line</h3>
    <p>
      A corporate merger is not required for a single-carrier / single-transportation-system finding.
      The NMB focuses on substance over form: common management, centralized labor relations,
      and integrated operations can be enough.
    </p>
  </section>

  <p>
    Once single-carrier questions become live, the practical representation path usually runs through
    <a href="#section-majority-absorption">majority absorption</a> and/or a
    <a href="#section-showing-of-interest">showing of interest</a> before the group moves toward a
    single <a href="#section-jcba">JCBA</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Majority absorption -->
<section id="section-majority-absorption" class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Majority absorption</h2>
  <p>
    Majority absorption occurs when, in a merger or single-carrier context,
    the National Mediation Board (NMB) determines that one union represents
    more than 50% of the combined craft or class. If no competing claim is filed,
    the NMB may certify that union as the representative of the entire combined
    workforce without an election. Majority absorption can materially affect
    seniority integration processes, the collective bargaining environment, and
    the eventual scope and character of a merged contract.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Showing of interest -->
<section id="section-showing-of-interest" class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Showing of interest (SOI)</h2>
  <p>
    Showing of interest (SOI) is the formal demonstration—usually via signed
    authorization cards—that a significant portion of the craft or class wishes to be
    represented by a different union than the one that would otherwise obtain representation
    through majority absorption. The NMB generally requires at least 35% SOI to trigger an
    investigation or election. A timely SOI can block or delay automatic majority absorption,
    shifting the representation outcome from an automatic certification to a contested
    process under NMB supervision.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a single-carrier determination, majority absorption or an election resolves
    which union is certified as representative of the combined group. Joint contract
    negotiations do not begin immediately at that point. The certified union must first
    establish merged governance structures, complete or verify a merged seniority list
    under its own merger policy, and develop unified bargaining goals. Only after those
    internal steps, and with the National Mediation Board’s involvement where required,
    do joint negotiations toward a single, merged contract for the craft or class actually begin—typically
    months, not days, after a single-carrier determination.
  </p>
</section>
    

      <!-- JCBA -->
      <section id="section-jcba" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA)</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>joint collective bargaining agreement</strong>, or JCBA, is the contract that
          governs the combined group of employees after a merger or single-carrier finding.
          Negotiating a JCBA is often the last major step in “completing” a merger from the crew
          perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          The path typically runs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Management announces a deal structure (merger, integration, or hybrid);</li>
          <li>Regulators review and act on the transaction;</li>
          <li>The NMB addresses <a href="#section-single-carrier">single-carrier</a> questions;</li>
          <li>
            Representation is clarified and <a href="#section-seniority">seniority integration</a> is addressed;
          </li>
          <li>A JCBA is negotiated to combine or update contract language for the unified group.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The quality and timing of the JCBA go a long way toward determining whether crews see the
          combination as value-creating or value-destructive for their careers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Seniority integration -->
      <section id="section-seniority" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Seniority integration</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Seniority integration</strong> combines two or more seniority lists into one.
          For pilots, flight attendants, and other crafts, seniority determines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Base placement and equipment;</li>
          <li>Monthly schedule quality;</li>
          <li>Upgrade timing and long-term earnings;</li>
          <li>Exposure during downsizing or volatility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Different mergers and <a href="#section-structures">transaction structures</a> can imply
          very different seniority integration paths, including negotiated lists, arbitrated solutions,
          or formulas defined in a merger agreement or union policy.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Fences -->
      <section id="section-fences" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Fences</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Fences</strong> are temporary rules that limit the movement of flying, bases,
          or equipment between pre-merger groups until all key integration steps are complete.
          They are often negotiated to protect each group during the transition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fences can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stabilize base and equipment assignments for a defined period;</li>
          <li>Limit displacement caused by rapid schedule or fleet shifts;</li>
          <li>Give time to resolve <a href="#section-seniority">seniority</a> and
              <a href="#section-jcba">JCBA</a> issues before full mixing;</li>
          <li>Provide predictable phases for how flying and crews move between operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From the line perspective, the details of fence language can be as consequential
          as the headline merger or integration announcement itself.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Scope -->
      <section id="section-scope" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Scope</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Scope clauses</strong> define what flying must be done by the bargaining unit.
          In integration or merger scenarios, scope can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Protect flying from being outsourced or shifted to affiliates;</li>
          <li>Limit how much capacity can be moved to non-represented or lower-cost entities;</li>
          <li>Constrain management’s ability to “restructure” using parallel certificates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where scope is weak, flying can migrate outside the mainline list even as the company
          describes the transaction as a <a href="#section-merger">merger</a> or
          <a href="#section-integration">integration</a>. Understanding how scope interacts with
          the proposed structure is critical for line crews.
