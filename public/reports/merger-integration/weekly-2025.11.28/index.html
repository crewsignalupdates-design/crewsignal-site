    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">1. Republic–Mesa: Transaction Closed, Integration Begins</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Republic Airways Holdings has now confirmed the successful completion of its merger with Mesa Air Group,
      creating one of the largest U.S. regional platforms by E-Jet fleet and daily departures. Public reporting
      indicates Mesa shareholders approved the combination earlier in November, with closing targeted for the
      week of November 25 and now confirmed. Republic shareholders are expected to hold roughly 88% of the
      combined company’s common stock, underscoring who will effectively control the integration agenda. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      On the network side, the combined carrier’s E-170/E-175 fleet now exceeds 300 frames, positioning it as
      the world’s largest E-Jet operator and a key feed provider into legacy partners’ hubs. That scale is a
      strategic asset — but only if integration is executed without protracted labor disruption or operational
      instability. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">2. Alaska–Hawaiian: Quiet Phase, Heavy Prep</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      While headline news around the Alaska–Hawaiian transaction has been quieter in the last week, union and
      association updates continue to emphasize “combined carrier status” work at the National Mediation Board
      and internal preparation for future representation and seniority processes. Mechanic and related groups
      are signaling that representation decisions and integration frameworks are coming into focus for 2026. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      For now, this remains a planning and positioning phase rather than a public inflection point, but Crew
      Signal continues to treat Alaska–Hawaiian as a high-impact integration story for West Coast and
      trans-Pacific flying.

  <!-- Section 3: Labor & Mediation overlay on merger risk -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">3. Labor Tension as an Integration Risk Multiplier</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Outside of formal merger announcements, the labor backdrop remains tense in parts of the industry.
      Allegiant pilots, represented by the Teamsters, staged coordinated informational picketing at 22 U.S.
      airports on November 18, citing stalled contract talks, below-market pay, and scheduling concerns. While
      this is not a merger-driven dispute, it illustrates how unresolved labor issues can quickly become an
      integration risk factor for any carrier trying to grow or consolidate capacity. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      More broadly, investors and employees are both treating “labor stability” as a key success metric for
      post-merger integration. Consolidation that looks attractive on paper can unwind quickly if contract
      talks, scope, or scheduling disputes spill into operational disruption during what should be a
      stabilization phase.
