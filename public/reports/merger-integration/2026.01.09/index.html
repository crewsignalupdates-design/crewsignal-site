      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The week ending 2026.01.09 produced no new publicly visible merger filings, acquisition announcements,
        or structural integration expansions across U.S. airlines. This was a continuity week for deal headlines,
        with most observable signals remaining operational rather than transactional.
      </p>

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Integration tracks already in motion continued under existing frameworks. Public communications remained
        execution-oriented, with no material change in scope or regulatory posture observed during the reporting period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Labor-relevant indicators (representation filings, seniority integrations, JCBA sequencing signals)
        did not show notable new activity in publicly available sources this week.
      </p>

      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Any shift from partnership framing toward merger framing in carrier communications.</li>
        <li>Regulatory activity tied to slot concentration, competitive effects, or market access constraints.</li>
        <li>Labor-sequencing signals that indicate integration gating: seniority, JCBA posture, or base/equipment allocation decisions.</li>
        <li>Operational coordination changes that materially alter the representation or single-carrier lens.</li>
