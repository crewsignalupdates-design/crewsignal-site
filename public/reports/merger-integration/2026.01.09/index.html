    <p>
      This week reflected continued stability across publicly visible airline merger and
      integration activity. No new merger filings, acquisition announcements, or formal
      integration expansions were disclosed during the reporting period.
    </p>

    <p>
      Existing integration arrangements—including alliance-style partnerships and limited
      operational coordination agreements—continued along previously documented paths
      without material change. Public communications remained focused on execution rather
      than structural expansion.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a labor perspective, no new representation filings, seniority integrations,
      or bargaining consolidation initiatives were observed. Carrier labor relations activity
      remained contract-centric and operationally bounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      CrewSignal will continue monitoring for changes in regulatory posture, alliance framing,
      or labor-affecting operational coordination that could signal a shift from integration
      toward formal consolidation.
