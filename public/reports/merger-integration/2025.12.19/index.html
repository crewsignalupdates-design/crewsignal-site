    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
    company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
    crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
    or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
    carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
    and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
    consolidation signals.

<!-- Section 1: Headline Transaction -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    This was a continuity week in the public signal set: CrewSignal did not identify material new public filings
    or definitive transaction milestones in the primary merger &amp; integration watchlist during this report window.
    In weeks like these, the dominant risk surface remains integration execution rather than headline deal flow —
    particularly operational sequencing, labor alignment, and regulatory gating.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Quiet weeks can still matter. Internal planning, systems convergence, and bargaining posture frequently evolve
    outside public view, and later inflection points can look “inevitable” in hindsight. CrewSignal continues to publish
    weekly to preserve a consistent timeline of observable events and reduce hindsight bias when the next discrete milestone
    arrives.
  </p>

  <div class="cs-report__callout">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Integration watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Regulatory gating:</strong> Any new docket activity or sequencing signals that revise timelines or create new conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Representation triggers:</strong> SOI-driven investigations, majority absorption scenarios, and other leading indicators that can move faster than operational integration.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution stability:</strong> Systems convergence, staffing/scheduling resilience, and labor alignment that determine whether integration becomes a reliability risk.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Section 2: This week’s narrative + continuity tracking -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    This week’s public-facing developments appear stable. In periods without new filings or discrete milestones,
    CrewSignal emphasizes continuity tracking and watchpoints rather than drawing conclusions from the absence of updates.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    From a structural perspective, “quiet” weeks are often when integration sequencing and labor posture evolve quietly.
    The integration clock can move on different timelines than the public-news cycle, and representation-level developments
    can accelerate in ways that outpace operational convergence.
  </p>

  <div class="cs-report__callout cs-report__callout--neutral">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Crew Signal integration read – 2025.12.19</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Deal flow:</strong> No material new public milestones identified in the primary M&amp;I watchlist during this window.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory / representation:</strong> Continue monitoring docket activity and representation-level triggers as leading indicators.</li>
      <li><strong>System-wide:</strong> Integration execution risk remains a sequencing problem — stability can be tested before milestones become public.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Section 4: Quick reference -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What We’re Watching Next</h2>

  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li>Any new docket activity or regulatory signals indicating sequencing changes, revised timelines, or new gating events.</li>
    <li>Public-facing integration posture changes: fleet, scheduling, branding, or SOC / systems convergence indicators.</li>
    <li>Representation/organizing triggers that can accelerate (or constrain) integration pathways, including majority absorption and SOI-driven investigations.</li>
    <li>Labor risk indicators that could convert integration planning into a service-delivery or reliability risk surface.</li>
  </ul>
