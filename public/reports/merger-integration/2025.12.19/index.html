          <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
          This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available information as of the report date.
          It is prepared for informational purposes for aviation labor and industry readers and should not be interpreted
          as investment advice, bargaining guidance, legal advice, or a prediction of transaction or regulatory outcomes.
          CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
          and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating consolidation signals.

      <h2 class="cs-report__h2">This Week at a Glance</h2>
      <div class="cs-report__prose">
        <ul>
          <li>Continuity week: no material new public filings or definitive transaction milestones identified in the primary M&amp;I watchlist during this report window.</li>
          <li>Integration remains the dominant risk surface: operational sequencing, labor alignment, and regulatory gating continue to matter more than headline announcements.</li>
          <li>We continue to track representation-level triggers (including majority absorption and showing-of-interest thresholds) as structural inflection points that can move faster than operational integration timelines.</li>

      <h2 class="cs-report__h2">Developments</h2>
      <div class="cs-report__prose">
        <p>
          This week’s public signal set appears stable. In periods without new filings or discrete milestones,
          CrewSignal continues weekly publication to preserve a consistent timeline of observable events and to reduce
          hindsight bias when later inflection points occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a structural perspective, “quiet” weeks can still be consequential: internal planning, integration
          sequencing, and labor posture often evolve without public visibility. This report therefore emphasizes
          continuity tracking and watchpoints rather than speculative assertions.

      <div class="cs-report__prose">
        <p>
          No material new publicly visible regulatory docket activity was identified in the primary M&amp;I watchlist during this report window.
          CrewSignal continues to monitor representation-level triggers and docketed proceedings as leading indicators that can precede
          operational integration milestones.

      <div class="cs-report__prose">
        <p>
          Operational integration risk remains primarily a sequencing problem: systems convergence, staffing/scheduling stability, and labor alignment
          can move on different clocks. In continuity weeks, we emphasize watchpoints rather than drawing conclusions from absence of new public updates.

          <li>Any new docket activity or regulatory signals that indicate sequencing changes, revised timelines, or new gating events.</li>

          <li>Representation/organizing triggers that can accelerate (or constrain) integration pathways, including majority absorption scenarios and SOI-driven investigations.</li>
