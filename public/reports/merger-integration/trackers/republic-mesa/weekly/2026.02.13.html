    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Status Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Republic and Mesa are operating in a post-close phase in which the combined company has publicly indicated
      parallel operations will continue while work proceeds toward single-carrier consolidation.
      For flight attendants, the headline labor development remains the ratified JCBA (approved at 91%),
      positioned as a midterm “foundation” agreement that preserves full bargaining leverage for a 2027
      amendable cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This week, CrewSignal did not observe new public representation filings or changes to the joint labor
      framework. The most consequential near-term signals remain implementation mechanics (pay items like boarding pay,
      operational integration sequencing) and the durability of the IBT + CWA-AFA cooperative posture.
    </p>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Key Signals Observed</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        <strong>Joint representation framework remains intact.</strong> Public union communications continue to frame
        the merger as a coordinated IBT Local 135 + AFA-CWA (CWA-AFA) effort, explicitly aimed at preventing
        “divide-and-conquer” bargaining dynamics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JCBA implementation phase.</strong> The ratified JCBA is being communicated as a midterm step:
        boarding pay is highlighted as a major economic improvement (reported as up to 16% average compensation impact),
        while preserving full negotiations beginning January 2027.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seniority integration posture is defined early.</strong> Union communications emphasize date-of-hire
        seniority integration and explicitly reject a “system flush” that would force base displacement at integration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No new single-carrier triggers observed this week.</strong> No new public milestones were identified
        this week that would independently accelerate representation changes beyond the existing negotiated framework.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What CrewSignal Is Watching</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        <strong>Implementation cadence.</strong> Effective dates, pay-rule execution (including boarding pay),
        and whether implementation timelines align with operational integration steps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Operational consolidation sequencing.</strong> Any movement from “parallel operations” toward a
        consolidated single-carrier operation—and which internal systems change first (scheduling, training, manuals).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Representation durability.</strong> Any indication that the joint IBT + CWA-AFA approach changes form
        (e.g., new filings, revised joint governance, or messaging that signals a shift in how representation questions
        will be handled longer-term).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seniority list integration execution.</strong> Timeline, transparency, and whether the date-of-hire
        posture holds operationally (bidding seniority and base protections).
      </li>
    </ul>
