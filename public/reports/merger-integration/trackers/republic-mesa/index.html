    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Status Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Republic and Mesa remain in a post-close phase. Public company messaging has indicated the carriers will
      maintain parallel operations while working toward consolidation into a single carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      For flight attendants, the key recent labor milestone remains the ratified Joint Collective Bargaining Agreement
      (JCBA), approved by 91% of the combined Mesa and Republic flight attendant group. Union communications frame the JCBA
      as a midterm foundation agreement that preserves the right to full negotiations beginning January 2027, while delivering
      immediate improvements (notably boarding pay).

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Key Signals Observed</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        <strong>IBT + CWA-AFA joint posture remains central.</strong>
        Recent union communications explicitly credit solidarity between CWA-AFA and IBT Local 135 as the mechanism that prevented management from using the merger window to divide the workgroup.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JCBA ratification sets near-term rules of the road.</strong>
        The combined group ratified the JCBA by 91%, with union messaging emphasizing that full negotiations begin in
        January 2027 and that boarding pay is a headline economic gain (described as increasing compensation up to 16% on average).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MTA / expedited bargaining framework is a key structural signal.</strong>
        Mesa CWA-AFA merger communications describe a Merger Transition Agreement (MTA) involving CWA-AFA, IBT, Republic, and Mesa,
        establishing an expedited JCBA pathway.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No new representation filings identified this week.</strong>
        CrewSignal did not observe new public changes this week indicating a shift away from the current joint union posture
        or a new representation-election trigger.
      </li>

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What CrewSignal Is Watching</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        <strong>Implementation mechanics.</strong>
        Effective dates, payroll execution, and whether boarding pay and other midterm items are implemented smoothly across the combined group.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Operational consolidation sequencing.</strong>
        Any public movement from “parallel operations” toward integrated systems that could precede single-carrier representation timing signals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Joint representation durability.</strong>
        Whether the CWA-AFA + IBT Local 135 cooperative framework persists through implementation friction and into the run-up to 2027 bargaining.
