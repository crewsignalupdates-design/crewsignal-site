          <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This analysis compares the pre-merger contract structures contained in the source documents listed below,
          plus the published JCBA summary/communications. It focuses on alignment friction and “what remains unresolved.”

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Is the current agreement the JCBA?</h2>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          <strong>Yes.</strong> Public union communications explicitly describe the ratified agreement as a <strong>JCBA</strong>, and the IBT summary describes it as a
          joint collective bargaining agreement with an effective date in 2026 and a defined “full negotiations begin in 2027” pathway.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          The key nuance is that it functions as a <strong>stabilizing / foundation JCBA</strong>:
          it produces a joint agreement now (with headline improvements such as boarding pay), while explicitly preserving a later bargaining window for a fuller successor contract.
        </p>

      <section class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Why the “joint representation” structure matters</h2>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          Republic’s flight attendants are represented by the <strong>IBT</strong>. Mesa’s flight attendants are represented by <strong>CWA-AFA</strong>.
          The published narrative from both sides emphasizes coordinated bargaining posture across unions as the reason a joint agreement was reached quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          This matters because it changes the typical merger trajectory: instead of prolonged parallel agreements, the parties created a joint agreement early,
          then deferred the “full” rewrite until 2027.
