          It is designed to surface “alignment friction” that tends to become contentious in a JCBA process.

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Pay architecture mismatch:</strong> Alaska’s pay system is built around a defined crediting framework (TFP and pay protections),
            while Hawaiian’s legacy agreement is built around hourly rate tables and distinct pay rule mechanics.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Boarding/ground-time compensation parity:</strong> Alaska’s agreement explicitly contains boarding-pay provisions; Hawaiian’s legacy structure is different.
            If one group is “paid for more time on duty,” that becomes a high-visibility JCBA issue.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Reserve quality-of-life:</strong> reserve pickup windows, open flying visibility indicators, and fatigue programs can become the true ratification drivers.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Benefit &amp; incentive alignment:</strong> Hawaiian’s extension replaces profit sharing with Alaska’s PBP plan and adopts additional Alaska-style programs,
            but “benefit identity” issues can still remain for JCBA bargaining.

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">How the Hawaiian extension attempts to bridge the gap</h2>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          The Hawaiian extension is a classic “bridge” tool: it reduces immediate divergence and imports selected Alaska program structures while JCBA talks continue.
          Key bridge components include:
        </p>
        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Wage adjustments:</strong> a 6% increase at the date of ratification, followed by 3% increases at DOR+1 and DOR+2.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Profit-sharing replacement:</strong> Hawaiian profit sharing is replaced with Alaska’s PBP program.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Program alignment imports:</strong> adoption of Alaska’s Operational Performance Reward (OPR) program and fatigue program structure.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Reserve and open-flying mechanics:</strong> modified reserve pickup rules and “open flying indicators” aligned to Alaska-style visibility.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Duration / amendable alignment:</strong> amendable date aligned to <strong>February 28, 2028</strong>, matching the bridge’s intent to stabilize terms through JCBA construction.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="cs-report__body">
          <strong>What it does not do:</strong> a bridge can narrow gaps, but it typically does not eliminate the largest philosophical differences (pay-credit architecture,
          boarding/ground-time compensation design, reserve “life,” or how schedule flexibility is governed). Those are the JCBA battlegrounds.
