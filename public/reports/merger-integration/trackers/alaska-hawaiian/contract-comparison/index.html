        <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
        This comparison is informational and focuses on observable contract structure. It is not legal advice, bargaining guidance,
        or a prediction of JCBA outcomes. Where contract language is complex or highly context-dependent, CrewSignal prioritizes the
        <em>practical crew impact</em> and the <em>integration/JBCA implications</em> rather than exhaustive clause-by-clause quotation.

      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>The core structural gap is pay architecture:</strong> Alaska is built around a <strong>TFP-based</strong> system with distinct constructs (including boarding pay expressed in TFP),
          while Hawaiian is built around <strong>hourly flight-time pay</strong> plus premium pay and ground-time provisions.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          The <strong>2025 Hawaiian Comprehensive Extension Agreement</strong> is a bridge in several important ways:
          it aligns amendability timing with Alaska’s agreement, imports Alaska Air Group-style performance programs,
          and adjusts reserve/availability mechanics—without fully harmonizing the underlying pay system.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>JCBA contention risk is highest</strong> where harmonization forces one group to “convert” into the other group’s structure:
          pay basis (TFP vs hourly), boarding/ground-time compensation, per diem/expense allowance standards, and reserve rules.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Pay Architecture</h2>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Why pay basis is the biggest JCBA problem</h3>
      <p>
        Alaska’s agreement expresses pay in a <strong>TFP-based</strong> architecture (including boarding pay expressed in TFP).
        Hawaiian’s agreement expresses pay in <strong>hourly flight-time pay</strong> with additional premium positions and defined ground-time pay triggers.
        A JCBA must ultimately choose one set of “units” as the dominant architecture or create a conversion system that crews view as fair.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Alaska: step rates + boarding pay expressed in TFP</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Alaska’s base rates are expressed per TFP (with block-hour equivalents referenced in the contract).
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Alaska boarding pay is explicitly stated as <strong>0.50 TFP per segment</strong> (non-creditable to other pay calculations).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Hawaiian: hourly pay + premium pay + ground holding pay rules</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Hawaiian hourly rates are stated by year of service (e.g., the agreement includes a Year 20+ step and a longevity add-on for 25+ years).
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Hawaiian includes defined premium pay categories (e.g., galley/lead/“#1,” language, purser positions depending on equipment).
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Hawaiian also includes <strong>ground holding pay</strong> triggers tied to elapsed ground time thresholds (originating vs through flights; domestic vs international).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section class="cs-report__callout">
        <h3>JCBA Watch</h3>
        <p>
          If Alaska/Hawaiian JCBA talks move toward harmonizing “paid time,” the likely flashpoints are:
          <strong>(1)</strong> whether boarding pay exists as a per-segment entitlement,
          <strong>(2)</strong> what replaces Hawaiian ground-time triggers,
          and <strong>(3)</strong> whether any conversion produces “hidden” winners/losers across different trip mixes.

      </section>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="per-diem">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Expense Allowance / Per Diem</h2>
      <p>
        Both agreements provide time-based expense pay, but with different rate structures and trip categorization logic.
        In a JCBA, per diem becomes contentious when crews perceive that the harmonized structure undervalues the realities of their flying.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Alaska</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Alaska per diem is stated as a single hourly rate with scheduled increases across the agreement term.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Start/stop timing is tied to required check-in and a defined post-arrival window.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Hawaiian</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Hawaiian uses an <strong>hourly expense allowance</strong> with different rates (e.g., interisland vs international categories).
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          Start/stop timing is tied to a defined window before report and after return to domicile.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>JCBA risk:</strong> Medium–High. Even small per diem changes have large cumulative effects and are easy for crews to benchmark against peers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="performance-programs">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Performance Programs (Profit Sharing vs Performance-Based Pay)</h2>
      <p>
        One of the clearest “bridge” moves in the Hawaiian extension is the shift toward Alaska Air Group-style performance programs.
        This is an integration signal: it reduces structural separation in how company-wide performance value is distributed.
      </p>

      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          The extension replaces Hawaiian’s legacy profit-sharing framework with the Alaska Air Group performance-based pay plan.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          The extension includes participation in Alaska’s Operational Performance Rewards (OPR) program.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>JCBA risk:</strong> Medium. This is less “identity-level” than pay basis, but can become contentious if eligibility, metrics, or payout timing differ by group.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="reserve">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Reserve & Scheduling Mechanics</h2>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Structural note</h3>
      <p>
        Reserve systems are often where crews feel the integration pain first. Even when pay and benefits are improving,
        reserve rules control predictability, rest, and the lived experience of the job.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Extension “bridge” signals</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          The extension modifies reserve pick-up on guaranteed days off by tying eligibility to <strong>actual rest</strong> rather than scheduled rest.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          The extension introduces an incentive concept: reserves who exceed a defined threshold on days off are paid at a <strong>1.5x multiplier</strong> for hours above the threshold.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          The extension adds open-flying visibility signals (operational transparency that affects how quickly open-time is absorbed and who gets access).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>JCBA risk:</strong> Medium–High. Reserve harmonization is often a high-emotion issue because it impacts fatigue, family life, and scheduling control.
      </p>

      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>Pay basis conversion:</strong> whether the JCBA uses TFP, hourly, or a hybrid—and whether conversion creates “silent” losers.
