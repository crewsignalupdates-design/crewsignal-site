    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Status Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This week’s primary integration signal was a pre-merger Hawaiian SEA domicile
      vacancy and process update, including a negotiated process (LOA) and a posted bid/award timeline for
      permanent SEA positions effective May 1, 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
      CrewSignal continues to treat “crew mobility” (who can bid/operate which flying) as a JCBA-dependent milestone.
      Published union guidance reiterates that, until JCBA ratification and implementation, pre-merger Alaska and
      pre-merger Hawaiian flight attendants remain separated and fly separately under their own seniority lists,
      aircraft, work rules, and schedules.

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Key Signals Observed</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        <strong>SEA domicile vacancy mechanics (pre-merger Hawaiian).</strong>
        Union communications describe 121 permanent SEA vacancies effective May 1, 2026, with bids closing
        February 16 (11:59 PM HT) and awards posting February 17 (12:00 PM HT), and reference a Letter of Agreement
        covering the SEA vacancy bidding process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Explicit separation until JCBA.</strong>
        Guidance reiterates that Alaska flight attendants cannot bid into that Hawaiian SEA domicile and that only
        Hawaiian flight attendants will operate those groupings/aircraft until JCBA ratification and final integration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Corporate integration milestone remains “behind the scenes.”</strong>
        Alaska/Hawaiian have achieved a single operating certificate while continuing to operate as two brands—important
        background context, but not the same as a merged flight attendant contract or cross-utilization.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What CrewSignal Is Watching</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>
        <strong>SEA bid/award execution.</strong> Whether awards post on schedule, whether the LOA process holds cleanly,
        and whether any disputes arise around relocation/moving provisions connected to SEA staffing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>JCBA sequencing signals.</strong> Any publication of tentative agreements by section, major work-rule
        harmonization moves, or explicit messaging about when cross-flying and schedule mixing could begin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Systems/scheduling harmonization.</strong> Any evidence that crew-facing scheduling tools or policies
        are being aligned in ways that precede labor-mobility changes.
      </li>
