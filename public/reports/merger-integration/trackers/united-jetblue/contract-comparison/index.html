          <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> This page compares the contract structures contained in the source documents listed below.
          It does <em>not</em> assume a merger. Blue Sky is a commercial partnership; this analysis exists to help crews and observers
          understand “alignment friction” if the relationship ever escalates into a consolidation pathway.

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Representation mismatch:</strong> United flight attendants are represented by <strong>CWA-AFA</strong>; JetBlue flight attendants are represented by <strong>TWU</strong>.
            In any single-carrier scenario, NMB representation mechanics (craft/class) would be unavoidable.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Premium pay triggers differ:</strong> United uses an “incentive pay” construct tied to quarterly credited time thresholds, while JetBlue uses a bid-period premium model
            (with a distinct premium pay scale and a defined threshold for premium compensation).
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Reserve architecture is structurally different:</strong> both carriers use reserve concepts, but JetBlue’s reserve line construction rules and assignment mechanics are
            explicitly codified in ways that may not map cleanly to United’s system without negotiated translation.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>International complexity vs network profile:</strong> United’s long-haul/international flying footprint creates work-rule requirements (pairing construction,
            rest, premium positions) that do not perfectly parallel JetBlue’s historic network structure. Any combined agreement must decide which rule set becomes the “pattern.”

                <td>
                  Base pay table shows top-step base rate reaching the high-$60/hr range in the referenced schedule; incentive rates are higher for credited time above the quarterly threshold.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Straight scale reaches <strong>$62.25</strong> at Year 13 (1/1/2026); Premium scale reaches <strong>$66.00</strong> at Year 13 (1/1/2026).
                </td>
                <td>
                  If a JCBA ever becomes necessary, the “pattern” question (which pay architecture wins) becomes immediate: hourly tables alone are not the whole story — the premium triggers matter.

              <tr>
                <td><strong>Premium / incentive trigger</strong></td>
                <td>
                  “Incentive Pay Rates” apply to block hours credited above a quarterly threshold (e.g., credited time above 200 hours per quarter in the referenced schedule).
                </td>
                <td>
                  Premium pay is tied to bid-period credit: premium scale applies to credited time above a defined threshold, and the agreement describes premium pay as <strong>125%</strong>
                  for credit above the threshold (with an election process for premium vs straight pay).
                </td>
                <td>
                  Two different premium philosophies: “quarterly incentive” vs “bid-period premium.” This is a classic JCBA friction point.

                <td><strong>Duty rig</strong></td>
                <td>
                  United includes a duty-rig concept summarized as 1 hour credit for each 2 hours on duty (plus pairing minimums such as a minimum one-day pairing value).
                </td>
                <td>
                  JetBlue includes a duty-rig concept summarized as 1 hour credit for each 2 hours on duty, and also codifies minimum duty-period credit rules.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Similar headline “1:2” duty-rig language can still hide major differences in pairing minimums, definitions, exclusions, and how credit is computed.

              <tr>
                <td><strong>Reserve construction (example signal)</strong></td>
                <td>
                  Reserve systems exist, but are embedded in United’s broader scheduling architecture and may not mirror JetBlue’s line construction rules directly.
                </td>
                <td>
                  JetBlue explicitly constructs reserve lines as blocks (e.g., 3–6 days) with defined days off and assignment rules including next-day assignment timing language.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Even if pay tables align, reserve life can become the ratification “dealbreaker.” Merging reserve systems is often harder than merging wages.

              <tr>
                <td><strong>Network-driven work rules</strong></td>
                <td>
                  United’s contract architecture supports a global network and associated pairing complexity.
                </td>
                <td>
                  JetBlue’s agreement is built around JetBlue’s operating profile and staffing model.
                </td>
                <td>
                  A combined agreement must decide whether international pairing rules are “upgraded,” “localized,” or handled with separate letter/appendix language.
