        <p class="cs-report__body">
          The United/JetBlue “Blue Sky” collaboration is not a merger, but deeper interoperability often triggers
          direct peer benchmarking: crews compare pay-credit mechanics, reserve control, schedule quality,
          and enforcement tools across airlines doing adjacent flying in overlapping markets.

          This report summarizes <em>contract structure</em> differences that tend to drive real-life outcomes:
          what gets paid, how schedules are built and modified, and how rules are enforced.

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>“What gets paid” is as important as the hourly rate:</strong> both contracts include pay protections and add-on pay concepts,
            but they express them differently (credit protections vs distinct pay adders).
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Reserve design drives quality-of-life:</strong> the “shape” of reserve blocks, call-out rules, and day-off protection
            tends to dominate member satisfaction even when wages rise.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Time-off architecture differs:</strong> separate vacation/sick banks vs a PTO-style approach changes how flexibility
            works in practice and how absenteeism is managed.

                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Uses credit/pay protections tied to line projection and reassignment mechanics (example: protections built around a 71:00
                  pay floor for certain lineholder scenarios).
                </td>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Expresses guarantees more directly (e.g., minimum lineholder and reserve monthly guarantees in the agreement materials),
                  plus explicit “pay adders” (see below).

                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Reserve life is heavily determined by scheduling procedures, assignment rules, and pay protections when disrupted.
                  (Key analytical lens: how often “reserve days” turn into long duty days and how protected days off behave.)
                </td>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Reserve is explicitly organized into blocks of consecutive reserve days (3–6), with protections like required days off
                  between blocks and defined assignment mechanics.

                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Uses items such as call-out pay / reserve-related pay provisions and holiday/training pay constructs.
                </td>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Includes defined items like Call-No-Go / Show-No-Go and a “supplementary pay” concept tied to duty time (report-to-release).
                </td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;"><strong>Scheduling & modifications</strong></td>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Uses detailed scheduling procedures plus disruption protections; the “real contract” often emerges in reassignment rules,
                  legality protections, and pay-credit outcomes after irregular operations.
                </td>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Breaks scheduling into distinct articles (scheduling, reschedule, bidding, exchanges), making it easier to isolate where
                  change occurs and what “bucket” a dispute belongs to.
                </td>

                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;"><strong>Time off</strong></td>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Typically structured with separate vacation and sick/medical constructs (plus leaves), which can create sharper boundaries
                  between “planned time off” and “protected absence.”
                </td>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Uses a PTO-based architecture with accrual by years of service plus VPTO concepts—changing how flexibility and attendance
                  tradeoffs work in practice.
                </td>

                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Grievance structure and arbitration/system-board pathways are central to enforcement; practical outcomes depend on timeline,
                  burden, and remedy strength.
                </td>
                <td style="padding:10px; border-bottom:1px solid #e2e8f0;">
                  Separates disciplinary vs non-disciplinary grievances in structure, plus a System Board of Adjustment pathway—often clarifying
                  process and remedies by category.

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Deeper dive: what tends to move outcomes</h2>

        <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">1) Pay-credit mechanics under disruption</h3>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          In real-world operations, “how you get paid when the trip breaks” often matters as much as the published rate.
          Look for: protections tied to original line value, reassignment outcomes, and what counts as compensable duty time.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">2) Reserve control and predictability</h3>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          Reserve systems that limit block length, protect days off, and constrain assignment windows tend to reduce fatigue and improve schedule stability.
          Reserve disputes often concentrate around notification timing, reassignment sequences, and whether “off days” are genuinely protected.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">3) Time-off architecture (PTO vs segmented banks)</h3>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          PTO-style systems can increase flexibility but can also shift how attendance is incentivized and enforced.
          Segmented vacation/sick structures can protect illness-specific use but often reduce “general-purpose flexibility.”
        </p>

        <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">4) Enforcement strength</h3>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          A contract is only as strong as its enforceability: grievance timelines, remedy language, and system-board/arbitration pathways
          determine whether violations are rare or simply “priced in.”
        </p>

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Public context: Blue Sky is not a merger</h2>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          This comparison is provided because deeper interoperability often increases peer benchmarking pressure.
          It does not imply the carriers are moving toward a combined certificate or a single labor group.
