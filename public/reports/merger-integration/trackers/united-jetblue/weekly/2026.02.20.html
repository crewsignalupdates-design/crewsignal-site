      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Status Summary</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        United and JetBlue’s “Blue Sky” relationship remains a commercial partnership, not a corporate merger.
        The most concrete integration signal in this phase is that cross-selling has expanded: customers can book
        eligible flights from either carrier on the other carrier’s website/app, and loyalty earn/redeem functionality
        continues to roll out in parallel.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        From a crew perspective, Blue Sky does not inherently change employer-of-record, seniority, or representation.
        However, deeper commercial integration can still matter for scope-sensitive flying allocation and long-run
        network strategy at constrained airports.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Key Signals Observed</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>Cross-platform booking is now a live integration feature.</strong>
          This is a higher-commitment “plumbing” step than a basic codeshare announcement because it touches retail,
          inventory, and customer handling workflows.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>Spring 2026 remains the stated window for reciprocal “elite” style benefits.</strong>
          Until those benefits are fully implemented, this remains a partial integration state.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>2027 JFK slot usage remains the longer-horizon structural marker.</strong>
          Regardless of how the partnership is branded, the timing of JFK/EWR slot/frequency implementation is a key
          indicator of how durable (and operationally meaningful) the relationship becomes.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>No labor-integration triggers observed this week.</strong>
          There is no public indication of a single-carrier pathway, combined operating certificate, or representation
          convergence. This continues to look like “commercial integration,” not “labor integration.”

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What CrewSignal Is Watching</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>Whether cooperation expands beyond sales/loyalty into operations.</strong>
          Examples: rebooking protections, irregular-ops handling, baggage/airport process alignment, customer reaccommodation.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>Any measurable flying-allocation shift at slot-constrained airports.</strong>
          Network reallocations can create “scope pressure” even absent a merger.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>Any new regulatory or litigation posture.</strong>
          Even partnerships can draw scrutiny depending on practical coordination depth.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>Contract-alignment friction (if the relationship ever escalates).</strong>
          Pay crediting, reserve structures, and premium triggers differ materially and would be JCBA pressure points
          in any future consolidation scenario.
