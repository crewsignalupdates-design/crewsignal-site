    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
    company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
    crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
    or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
    carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
    and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
    consolidation signals.

<!-- Section 1 -->
<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    No new substantive developments occurred during the week ending 2025.11.21 with respect to
    the United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” strategic partnership. Neither carrier issued updates related
    to loyalty-program integration, slot utilization timelines, or regulatory filings.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    In the absence of new public signals, CrewSignal treats this as a continuity week and
    maintains baseline tracking of regulatory posture, scope creep risk, and representation
    thresholds.
