    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
    company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
    crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
    or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
    carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
    and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
    consolidation signals.

      <!-- Overview -->
      <section id="section-overview" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Overview &amp; framing</h2>
        <p>
          In 2025, United and JetBlue announced and began implementing the <strong>“Blue Sky”</strong>
          collaboration. From the outset, the companies framed Blue Sky as an integration initiative —
          focused on loyalty reciprocity, slot and timing exchanges, and selective operational cooperation —
          rather than a traditional corporate merger.
        </p>
        <p>
          For crews, that distinction matters. A <a href="/reports/merger-integration/baseline/">merger vs. integration
          structure</a> dictates whether and when there might be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Representation changes or single-carrier issues;</li>
          <li>Seniority list integration;</li>
          <li>Joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA) requirements;</li>
          <li>Scope and fence questions affecting flying and bases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This report does not attempt to predict whether Blue Sky will eventually evolve into a formal merger.
          Instead, it tracks how far integration has progressed in 2025, what signals management, regulators,
          and labor have sent, and what line crews should watch as the structure matures.

      <section id="section-timeline" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">2025 year-to-date timeline</h2>
        <p>
          The key public milestones for Blue Sky in 2025 year-to-date include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>May 29, 2025 — Blue Sky announced.</strong>
            United and JetBlue unveil the collaboration as “Blue Sky,” centered on loyalty earn/burn reciprocity
            and a <strong>JFK↔EWR slot/timing exchange</strong>. Management stresses that Blue Sky is an
            integration arrangement and not a corporate merger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Early June 2025 — Management messaging.</strong>
            JetBlue’s leadership publicly reiterates that Blue Sky is <em>not</em> a step toward a formal
            merger, but rather a strategic partnership built around network and loyalty synergies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>June 24, 2025 — Spirit Airlines comments.</strong>
            Spirit files comments urging regulators to reject the collaboration as anticompetitive at
            constrained New York–area airports, highlighting slot and competition concerns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>July 29, 2025 — DOT review completed.</strong>
            The Department of Transportation completes its review and does not block Blue Sky, clearing
            the way for implementation of the loyalty and slot elements. No DOJ merger filing is opened.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>October 23, 2025 — Loyalty earn/redemption launch.</strong>
            Blue Sky moves from concept to customer-facing reality: TrueBlue and MileagePlus members can
            begin earning and redeeming across both networks. This is the first visible operational phase
            of the collaboration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Year-End 2025 — No new structural filings.</strong>
            Through the week ending November 14, there are <strong>no public merger filings, new antitrust
            cases, or structural changes</strong> announced beyond the previously disclosed cooperation
            framework and loyalty rollout.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As of this report, Blue Sky remains a commercial and operational integration framework between
          two separate carriers, operating against a tight regulatory backdrop and active labor environment.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Structure section -->
      <section id="section-structure" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Integration vs. merger: why structure matters</h2>
        <p>
          Blue Sky is formally described as a <strong>partnership/integration</strong> rather than a merger.
          That choice of structure has practical consequences for crews:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Corporate control and ownership remain separate; there is no single surviving corporation or
            unified operating certificate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each carrier’s existing contracts, seniority lists, and representation structures remain intact.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no automatic trigger for single-carrier questions, seniority integration, or JCBA
            negotiations for affected crafts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At the same time, <strong>integration-like outcomes</strong> can still appear: shared loyalty,
          coordinated schedules in key markets, and aligned slot and timing strategies. For crews, the central
          question is not just “Is this a merger?” but:
          <em>How far does this integration go, and how does it interact with representation, scope, and long-term
          control of flying?</em>
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Integration signals -->
      <section id="section-signals" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Integration signals to watch</h2>
        <p>
          Looking across 2025, several types of integration signals are relevant to crews tracking Blue Sky:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Loyalty integration.</strong>
            The October 23 launch of mutual earn/redemption between TrueBlue and MileagePlus is the clearest
            Blue Sky milestone so far. Crews should watch how broadly the programs align across fare classes,
            partner flights, and upgrade credit rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Slot and timing alignment.</strong>
            The forward-looking piece of Blue Sky — new JFK slot access for United and Newark timing positions
            for JetBlue — will take longer to materialize, but will be an important test of how operational
            control and connectivity are being coordinated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operational plumbing.</strong>
            Changes in interline behaviors, cross-booking flows, and schedule design (particularly at JFK and EWR)
            may indicate deeper integration of day-to-day operations even without a merger.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          None of these individual steps is equivalent to a corporate merger, but together they define the
          practical level of integration customers – and crews – experience.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Labor & representation -->
      <section id="section-labor" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Labor &amp; representation context</h2>
        <p>
          Blue Sky’s implementation is unfolding against an active labor backdrop, particularly for
          United flight attendants, who remain in a high-profile bargaining cycle. A previously reported
          tentative agreement was rejected in mid-year, and the union has continued internal work on
          priorities and leverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          For crews, the key questions are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whether and how Blue Sky’s growth intersects with staffing levels, reserve usage, and schedule
            construction;
          </li>
          <li>
            How management positions the collaboration in relation to compensation, productivity, and
            flexibility demands at the table;
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether any later-stage integration moves would raise single-carrier or representation questions
            under the Railway Labor Act.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As of the end of 2025, there have been <strong>no public representation changes or
          single-carrier determinations</strong> connected to Blue Sky.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Regulatory & antitrust -->
      <section id="section-regulatory" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Regulatory &amp; antitrust environment</h2>
        <p>
          Blue Sky operates in a regulatory environment shaped by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>DOT slot and access rules</strong> at constrained airports like JFK and EWR;
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>DOJ’s recent enforcement history</strong> in airline consolidation, including prior
            actions involving JetBlue;
          </li>
          <li>
            Competitor responses, including filings warning of potential competitive harm.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As of Year-End 2025:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            DOT has completed its review of Blue Sky and allowed implementation to proceed.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is <strong>no public DOJ merger filing</strong> for a United–JetBlue corporate combination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regulatory scrutiny remains elevated, especially with respect to slots and market concentration
            in the New York area, but within the disclosed integration framework.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any future move from integration toward a full merger would almost certainly face a more demanding
          antitrust review than earlier eras of consolidation.
        </p>

      <!-- YTD assessment -->
      <section id="section-ytd-assessment" class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Year-to-date assessment</h2>
        <p>
          Blue Sky has moved from announcement to early operational
          implementation. Loyalty earn/redemption is live, regulators have permitted the collaboration to
          proceed within its stated bounds, and slot/timing changes are queued for future phases.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, Blue Sky remains <strong>an integration framework, not a merger</strong>. There are
          no merger filings, no single-carrier findings, and no triggered seniority integration or JCBA
          requirements tied to the collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          For crews, the core takeaway is:
          <em>integration outcomes are beginning to show up in the marketplace, but they have not yet translated
          into structural labor changes under the Railway Labor Act.</em> The gap between commercial integration
          and representation/contractual clarity is the key space to watch going forward.
