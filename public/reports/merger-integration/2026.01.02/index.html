    <p>
      The opening week of 2026 did not produce new merger filings, acquisition announcements,
      or integration restructurings within the U.S. airline industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ongoing integration initiatives continued under existing frameworks, with public
      disclosures focused on operational execution rather than structural change.
      No expansion of coordination scope or governance was observed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Labor-related activity remained bounded by existing collective bargaining and
      representation structures. No seniority integrations, representation disputes,
      or labor consolidation signals were identified during the reporting period.
    </p>

    <p>
      This report establishes the baseline tracking posture for 2026, with subsequent
      weekly bulletins documenting any deviations from this stable opening position.
