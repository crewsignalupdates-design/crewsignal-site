      <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
      This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
      company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
      crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment advice
      or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes
      carefully between commercial partnerships, operational integrations, closed mergers,
      and representation-level single-carrier considerations when evaluating airline
      consolidation signals.

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      The week ending 2026.01.02 opened the new year with a continuation of the
      late-December pause across the airline merger and integration landscape. No new
      mergers, acquisitions, or formal integration milestones were announced, and no
      material regulatory filings were publicly disclosed. Previously identified
      transactions and partnerships remained in place without observable escalation
      or inflection. <p class="cs-report__body">
  Early-January activity often begins with repositioning rather than announcements,
  as carriers and labor organizations reset calendars and regulatory timelines resume.
  This report documents the week’s externally observable posture to preserve continuity
  in the 2026 merger and integration record.

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      <strong>United–JetBlue (“Blue Sky”):</strong> No DOT or DOJ filings, statements, or
      operational updates were disclosed during the reporting period. No labor-facing
      coordination or integration signals were identified. The arrangement continues to
      present as a commercial partnership rather than a structural integration.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      <strong>Alaska–Hawaiian Post-Merger Integration:</strong> The integration process
      remained externally quiet. No new public updates regarding fleet, network,
      branding, or labor integration were announced, and no Joint Negotiating Committee
      milestones were disclosed. Flight attendant labor negotiations continue to advance 
      incrementally rather than conclusively. Both Alaska Airlines’ and Hawaiian Airlines’ 
      flight attendant groups have ratified separate agreements that align amendable dates, 
      establishing the structural foundation for joint collective bargaining. Negotiations 
      are proceeding under a Joint Negotiating Committee on a section-by-section basis, and 
      while tentative agreements have reportedly been reached on limited portions of contract 
      language, a fully unified joint flight attendant contract has not yet been finalized or 
      ratified.      
    </p>
   
      <p class="cs-report__body">
      <strong>ULCC and Mid-Tier Carrier Activity:</strong> No consolidation activity,
      asset transfers, or partnership expansions were announced among ULCC or mid-tier
      carriers during the week.
