      Editor’s Note: This Merger &amp; Integration report is based solely on publicly available regulatory, company, and union-source
      information as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as investment
      advice or as a prediction of any specific merger outcome.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The week ending 2026.01.02 opened the 2026 tracking cycle without new publicly visible merger filings,
        acquisition announcements, or integration restructurings across U.S. airlines. This report sets a continuity
        baseline for weekly tracking in 2026.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Existing integration arrangements continued along previously documented paths, with public reporting focused
        on execution and operational reliability rather than structural change.
      </p>
      <p>
        No new labor-facing consolidation signals were identified in publicly available sources during the reporting period.
