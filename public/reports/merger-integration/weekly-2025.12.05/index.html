      <p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>  
      This weekly Merger & Integration update is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
      company, and union sources as of December 5, 2025. It is designed for crew and labor-focused
      readers and should not be interpreted as investment guidance or a prediction of any merger
      outcome. CrewSignal distinguishes clearly between partnerships, closed mergers, and
      representation-level single-carrier questions.</p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h3>1. Industry Overview</h3>
      <p>
        U.S. airline merger and integration activity remains relatively quiet entering December,
        but several active structures define the landscape:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Alaska–Hawaiian:</strong> The acquisition closed on September 18, 2024 following DOT approval with conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” Partnership:</strong> A loyalty and interline collaboration enabling reciprocal earning, redemption, and cross-platform selling.</li>
        <li><strong>Spirit–JetBlue:</strong> The terminated merger continues to shape regulatory expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Legacy carriers:</strong> Delta, American, and United remain focused on internal optimization rather than external M&A.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h3>2. United–JetBlue “Blue Sky” Partnership</h3>
      <p>
        United and JetBlue have launched a commercial partnership centered on loyalty integration
        and interline booking. MileagePlus and TrueBlue members now earn and redeem across both
        networks. Each carrier sells the other's flights through its own website and app.
      </p>
      <p>
        The collaboration remains customer-facing and commercial — not operational — with no
        evidence of joint labor negotiations, shared operational control, or unified scheduling.
        At present this does not meet any single-carrier criteria, but CrewSignal will monitor
        if the partnership expands in scope or influence.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h3>3. Spirit–JetBlue Fallout (Context Only)</h3>
      <p>
        The JetBlue–Spirit merger was terminated in March 2024 after DOJ litigation and judicial
        findings against the transaction. JetBlue has since shifted to a standalone strategy while
        building new cooperative partnerships. Spirit’s financial distress, including Chapter 11
        restructuring, continues to evolve but does not involve merger integration activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This remains relevant only as a regulatory precedent shaping how the DOJ views consolidation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h3>4. Alaska–Hawaiian Merger: Closed Deal & Labor Integration</h3>
      <p>
        Alaska Air Group’s acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines is now fully closed. Integration is
        progressing across loyalty, reservations, operations, and branding. A combined loyalty
        program, Atmos Rewards, has been announced, and as of October 2025 the carriers operate
        under a single FAA certificate.
      </p>

      <h4>Flight Attendant Integration (AFA–CWA)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>AFA’s Seniority Merger Integration Committee mailed verification packets to nearly 10,000 FAs in July 2025.</li>
        <li>Both pre-merger groups (Alaska and Hawaiian) have active Section 6 agreements ratified in 2025.</li>
        <li>A joint AFA JNC is negotiating the combined JCBA, with several non-economic sections tentatively agreed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Pilot Integration (ALPA)</h4>
      <p>
        Alaska and Hawaiian pilots opened JCBA negotiations with Alaska management in February 2025.

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h3>5. Regionals & ULCCs</h3>
      <p>
        No new mergers are announced at the ULCC or regional level. Spirit’s restructuring may
        create long-term vulnerability, while Frontier, Allegiant, and Sun Country remain potential
        consolidation actors depending on market conditions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h3>6. International (Labor-Relevant Only)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Korean Air–Asiana:</strong> Integration continues with labor harmonization challenges publicly discussed in Korean media.</li>
        <li><strong>Lufthansa–ITA Airways:</strong> Lufthansa’s 41% acquisition closed with EU conditions; representational and seniority harmonization will follow Lufthansa Group patterns.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <section class="cs-section">
      <h3>7. Weekly Outlook</h3>
      <p>
        CrewSignal will monitor progression in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any expansion of the United–JetBlue Blue Sky partnership;</li>
        <li>AFA JNC joint contract work and seniority integration milestones at Alaska–Hawaiian;</li>
        <li>Financial and strategic pressure at Spirit and JetBlue;</li>
        <li>Labor harmonization developments in Korean Air–Asiana and Lufthansa–ITA.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Updates will continue on a weekly cadence.
