    <h2>1. Representation Is a Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      For most flight attendants, “the union” feels like one entity. In practice, representation is a structured pipeline:
      local representation, system-wide coordination, and national governance. Understanding who does what — and where disputes
      go next — is the only way to evaluate responsiveness and accountability later.

    <h2>3. Where CWA Fits (Without District Intermediation)</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike most CWA locals that sit within both a sector and a geographic district, AFA’s representational ladder does not
      route through district offices. AFA operates as a national sector with its own internal governance pipeline, and interfaces
      with CWA governance primarily at the constitutional and convention level.
    </p>

    <div class="cs-block cs-block--callout">
      <h3>Practical takeaway</h3>
      <p>
        For flight attendants, most representational action occurs inside AFA’s LEC/MEC/International structure.
        CWA is the constitutional umbrella — not the day-to-day representation layer.

    <h2>4. Accountability and Escalation</h2>
    <p>
      Multi-layer systems can be powerful when escalation paths are clear and consistently used. They can also feel unresponsive
      when responsibility is ambiguous or when escalation becomes circular. This report series will later use the structure described
      here to evaluate responsiveness, transparency, and member outcomes.
