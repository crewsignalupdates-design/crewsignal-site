  <!-- Intro -->
  <section class="cs-block cs-block--narrow">
    <h2>1. Why Structure Matters</h2>
    <p>
      To understand how AFA operates within the Communications Workers of America (CWA),
      it is first necessary to understand how CWA organizes itself. CWA does not rely on
      a single hierarchy. Instead, it uses two intersecting structural axes —
      <strong>industrial sectors</strong> and <strong>geographic districts</strong> —
      each designed to solve a different organizational problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most CWA members belong to a local that is situated within both an industrial sector
      and a geographic district. AFA is a notable exception. This report explains why
      that exception exists and how it was deliberately created.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Industrial Sectors -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>2. Industrial Sectors: Organizing by Type of Work</h2>

    <p>
      Industrial sectors are the primary way CWA groups members according to the work
      they perform and the industries in which they operate. Sectors exist because
      bargaining strategy, safety regulation, legal frameworks, and employer behavior
      vary significantly by industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples of CWA industrial sectors include telecommunications, media and
      broadcasting, public sector employment, manufacturing, healthcare, and airlines.
      Each sector concentrates subject-matter expertise and develops strategies specific
      to that industry.

      For flight attendants, the relevant industrial sector is the airline sector,

  <!-- Geographic Districts -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>3. Geographic Districts: Organizing by Region</h2>

    <p>
      Geographic districts are the second major axis of CWA’s structure. Districts
      organize locals by physical location rather than by industry. They exist to manage
      functions that are inherently regional: administration, governance oversight,
      political activity, and staff deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
      CWA’s districts correspond roughly to major regions of the United States
      (for example, District 1 in the Northeast, District 3 in the Southeast, and
      District 9 on the West Coast). Each district has elected leadership and professional
      staff.
    </p>

      <h3>Functions of Geographic Districts</h3>

  <!-- Why AFA is different -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>4. Why AFA Does Not Operate Within CWA’s District System</h2>

    <p>
      AFA does not fit neatly into CWA’s geographic district model. Unlike most CWA locals,
      AFA’s local councils (LECs) are not defined by a single city, state, or region.
      They are defined by airline operations and flight attendant bases that often span
      multiple states and multiple CWA districts under a single employer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Airline bargaining, safety regulation, and contract enforcement are national —
      and often international — in scope. Placing AFA’s structure inside geographic
      districts would fragment authority, duplicate oversight, and undermine system-wide
      bargaining strategies.
    </p>

    <div class="cs-block cs-block--table">
      <h3>Standard CWA Model vs. AFA Model</h3>
      <table class="cs-table cs-table--compact">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Model</th>
            <th scope="col">Structural Flow</th>
            <th scope="col">Designed For</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Standard CWA Structure</td>
            <td>Local → Geographic District → Sector → CWA National</td>
            <td>Regionally anchored workplaces and employers.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>AFA–CWA Structure</td>
            <td>LEC → MEC → AFA International → CWA National</td>
            <td>National airline systems spanning multiple regions.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      During the 2003–2004 affiliation process, AFA and CWA explicitly preserved AFA’s
      internal governance and bargaining architecture. The result was a deliberate
      decision to seat AFA as a national industrial sector operating parallel to,
      rather than inside, the district system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Authority note -->
  <section class="cs-block cs-block--callout">
    <h2>5. Autonomy, with Constraints</h2>
    <p>
      AFA’s position outside the district system does not mean independence from CWA.
      AFA operates under its own constitution and maintains control over its internal
      representation, but it remains subject to the CWA Constitution for matters such
      as trusteeship, convention governance, and affiliation with the AFL-CIO.
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement — an autonomous, industry-specific sector operating within the
      constitutional framework of a larger international union — is unusual in U.S.
      labor law and is central to understanding both AFA’s strengths and its limitations.
