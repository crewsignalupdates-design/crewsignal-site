    <h2>1. Why Structure Matters</h2>
    <p>
      To understand how AFA operates within the Communications Workers of America (CWA),
      it is first necessary to understand how CWA organizes itself. CWA does not rely on
      a single hierarchy. Instead, it uses two intersecting structural axes —
      <strong>industrial sectors</strong> and <strong>geographic districts</strong> —
      each designed to address a different organizational and representational problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most CWA members belong to a local that is situated within both an industrial sector
      and a geographic district. AFA is a notable exception. This report explains why
      that exception exists and how it was deliberately created.

    <h2>2. Industrial Sectors: Organizing by Type of Work</h2>

    <p>
      Industrial sectors are the primary way CWA groups members according to the work
      they perform and the industries in which they operate. Sectors exist because
      bargaining strategy, safety regulation, legal frameworks, and employer behavior
      vary significantly by industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples of CWA industrial sectors include telecommunications, media and
      broadcasting, public sector employment, manufacturing, healthcare, and airlines.
      Each sector concentrates subject-matter expertise and develops strategies specific
      to that industry. Sectors operate as the primary locus for industry-specific strategy
      rather than as a secondary administrative layer.
