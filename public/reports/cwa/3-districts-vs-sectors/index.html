  <p class="cs-report__body">
    This report builds on the structural overview provided in “Structural Axes:
    Sectors and Districts” by comparing how CWA’s geographic district model and
    industrial sector model differ in practice, and why those differences matter
    for governance, accountability, and bargaining focus within AFA.
