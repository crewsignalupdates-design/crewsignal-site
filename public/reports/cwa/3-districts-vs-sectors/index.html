  <p class="cs-report__subtitle">
    A focused comparison of CWA’s geographic districts and industrial sectors,
    and why AFA is structured as a sector within CWA.
  </p>

<section class="cs-report__section">
<h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Purpose</h2>
  
  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The prior section (“Structural Axes: Sectors and Districts”) explains the two organizing dimensions CWA uses:
    industrial sectors and geographic districts. This report takes the next step by comparing how those structures
    function differently in practice, and why the distinction matters for authority, accountability, and bargaining
    focus within AFA’s sector model.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="cs-report__section">
<h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Districts: Governance by Geography</h2>  
  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Geographic districts organize representation and administration by region. Districts tend to excel at regional
    coordination: local escalation pathways, area-based governance, and managing member engagement across multiple
    industries in a defined territory. In practice, a district model is often well-suited to issues where geography
    is a meaningful organizing constraint.
  </p>
  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The trade-off is that geography alone does not inherently consolidate craft- or industry-specific bargaining
    demands. Where the key issues are driven by specialized work rules, industry regimes, or federal regulatory
    environments, geographic governance can become a less direct mechanism for prioritizing technical bargaining
    objectives.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="cs-report__section">
<h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Sectors: Governance by Industry and Craft</h2> 
  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Industrial sectors organize members around shared work categories and industry conditions rather than location.
    A sector model tends to centralize bargaining strategy, policy priorities, and subject-matter expertise for a
    defined workforce. It is effectively a governance lane built for specialized representation.
  </p>
  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The trade-off is that a sector model can concentrate decision-making at the national level. Because authority,
    resources, and priorities are organized through an industry lane, a sector structure can reduce the influence
    of purely local or carrier-specific preferences unless the sector’s internal governance mechanisms preserve them.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="cs-report__section">
<h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Why AFA Is Structured as a Sector</h2> 
    Flight attendants face a distinctive bargaining environment: scheduling and reserve systems, duty-time realities,
    safety and fatigue regimes, and a shared regulatory framework. Those conditions are more meaningfully organized by
    craft than by geography, which makes AFA’s placement as a national sector structurally rational within CWA.
  </p>
  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Sector placement also shapes how representation is “stacked” above the carrier level. The sector model implies that
    authority and accountability are routed through a national governance channel that does not originate solely from a
    single carrier membership. This becomes especially consequential when multiple carriers are simultaneously under
    negotiation or organizing emphasis.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="cs-report__section">
<h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Analytical Significance</h2> 
  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The district-versus-sector distinction is not merely organizational. It affects how priorities compete, how resources
    are allocated, and how accountability is enforced. District structures emphasize regional administration and local
    governance overlays. Sector structures emphasize craft-wide strategy and centralized bargaining coordination.
  </p>
  <p class="cs-report__body">
    For United flight attendants, this distinction frames the downstream questions that will appear throughout this series:
    where bargaining focus is set, how negotiation load is managed across carriers, and how governance authority can be
    exercised—formally and practically—within AFA’s position as a sector inside CWA.
