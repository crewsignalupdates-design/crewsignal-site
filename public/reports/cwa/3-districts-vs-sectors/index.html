  <!-- 1. Why this matters -->
  <section class="cs-block cs-block--narrow">
    <h2>1. Why Districts and Sectors Exist</h2>
    <p>
      The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is a large, multi-industry union representing
      hundreds of thousands of members across the United States. No single organizational
      structure can efficiently manage bargaining, governance, political action, and internal
      oversight across such a diverse membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this, CWA developed a dual structural model built around two parallel concepts:
      <strong>industrial sectors</strong> and <strong>geographic districts</strong>. Each structure
      serves a distinct purpose, and neither replaces the other.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-note">
      This dual-axis design is central to understanding how authority and responsibility are
      distributed inside CWA — and why some affiliates, including AFA, interact differently
      with these structures.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 2. Industrial sectors -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>2. Industrial Sectors: Organizing by Industry</h2>
    <p>
      Industrial sectors group members according to the industry in which they work. CWA
      represents workers in telecommunications, media, public service, manufacturing,
      healthcare, airlines, and other fields — each with its own employers, regulatory regimes,
      and bargaining dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sectors exist because effective representation requires deep familiarity with the
      operational, legal, and economic realities of a specific industry. Bargaining strategies
      that work in telecommunications may be ineffective — or even harmful — in aviation or
      public employment.
    </p>

    <div class="cs-block cs-block--table">
      <h3>Primary Functions of Industrial Sectors</h3>
      <table class="cs-table cs-table--compact">

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Legal &amp; Regulatory Expertise</td>
            <td>Specialized knowledge of governing laws and agencies affecting the industry.</td>

      </table>

    <p>
      Within CWA, sectors are the primary locus of expertise and strategic decision-making
      related to bargaining and industry conditions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 3. Geographic districts -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>3. Geographic Districts: Organizing by Region</h2>
    <p>
      Geographic districts organize locals by physical location rather than by industry.
      Districts exist because certain union functions are inherently regional, regardless of
      the type of work members perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      These functions include administrative oversight, governance compliance, political
      coordination, and the deployment of regional staff. District boundaries roughly align
      with major regions of the United States.
    </p>

    <div class="cs-block cs-block--table">
      <h3>Primary Functions of Geographic Districts</h3>
      <table class="cs-table cs-table--compact">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Function</th>
            <th scope="col">What the District Provides</th>

        </thead>

          <tr>

            <td>Charters, bylaws review, audits, and enforcement of constitutional standards.</td>

            <td>State-level lobbying, elections, and AFL-CIO coordination.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Regional Staffing</td>
            <td>Organizers, representatives, and training resources deployed locally.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Inter-Local Coordination</td>
            <td>Facilitation of cooperation among locals within a geographic area.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      Districts are therefore administrative and political in nature. They are not primarily
      designed to set bargaining strategy, but to support and oversee locals operating within
      a shared regional environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. How they coexist -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>4. How Districts and Sectors Work Together</h2>
    <p>
      For most CWA members, sector and district membership operate simultaneously.
      A local may belong to a particular industrial sector for bargaining and industry
      expertise, while also falling under a geographic district for governance oversight
      and political coordination.

    <p>
      This shared arrangement allows CWA to scale across industries and regions without
      centralizing all authority at the national level.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- 5. Where AFA fits -->
  <section class="cs-block cs-block--callout">
    <h2>5. Where AFA Fits in This Framework</h2>
    <p>
      AFA participates fully in CWA’s industrial sector framework but operates outside the
      geographic district system. This reflects the national, carrier-based structure of
      airline operations rather than a historical anomaly or informal exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, AFA functions as a sector that internalizes many functions typically
      handled by districts in other industries, while remaining subject to the overarching
      governance framework established by the CWA Constitution.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-note">
      The historical reasons for this arrangement — and the implications for authority and
      oversight — are addressed in subsequent sections.
