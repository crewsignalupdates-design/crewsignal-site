    <h2>1. Why Structure Matters</h2>
    <p>
      To understand how flight attendant representation through AFA operates within the
      Communications Workers of America (CWA), it is first necessary to understand how CWA
      organizes itself. CWA does not rely on a single hierarchical structure. Instead, it
      uses two intersecting structural axes —
      <strong>industrial sectors</strong> and <strong>geographic districts</strong> —
      each designed to address a different organizational and representational problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most CWA members belong to a local that exists simultaneously within an industrial
      sector and a geographic district. AFA is a notable exception. This report explains
      why that exception exists and how it was deliberately created.

  <!-- Industrial Sectors -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>2. Industrial Sectors: Organizing by Type of Work</h2>

    <p>
      Industrial sectors are the primary way CWA groups members according to the work
      they perform and the industries in which they operate. Sectors exist because
      bargaining strategy, safety regulation, legal frameworks, and employer behavior
      vary significantly by industry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples of CWA industrial sectors include telecommunications, media and broadcasting,
      public sector employment, manufacturing, healthcare, and airlines. Each sector
      concentrates subject-matter expertise and develops strategies specific to that
      industry. Sectors operate as the primary locus for industry-specific strategy rather
      than as a secondary administrative layer.

      For flight attendants, the relevant industrial sector is the airline sector,

  <!-- Geographic Districts -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>3. Geographic Districts: Organizing by Region</h2>

    <p>
      Geographic districts are the second major axis of CWA’s organizational structure.
      Districts organize locals by physical location rather than by industry or craft.
      They exist to manage functions that are inherently regional in nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      CWA’s districts correspond roughly to major regions of the United States
      (for example, District 1 in the Northeast, District 3 in the Southeast, and
      District 9 on the West Coast). Each district has elected leadership and
      professional staff responsible for regional administration and coordination.

  <!-- Why AFA is different -->
  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>4. Why AFA Operates Outside the District System</h2>

    <p>
      AFA does not fit neatly into CWA’s geographic district model. Unlike most CWA locals,
      AFA’s local councils (LECs) are not defined by a single city, state, or region.
      Instead, they are defined by airline operations and flight attendant bases that
      frequently span multiple states and multiple CWA districts under a single employer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Airline bargaining, safety regulation, and contract enforcement operate on a national —
      and often international — scale. Placing AFA’s structure inside geographic districts
      would introduce fragmented authority, duplicated oversight, and tension with
      system-wide bargaining strategies.
