          1. Overview of the Communications Workers of America (CWA)
        </h2>

        <p>
          The <strong>Communications Workers of America (CWA)</strong> is a federation of more than
          <strong>400,000 members</strong> in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. It is governed by
          the <strong>CWA Constitution</strong>, which delegates authority through three interconnected
          levels of representation:
        </p>

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li><strong>National</strong> – the Convention and Executive Board</li>
          <li><strong>Geographic</strong> – the Districts</li>
          <li><strong>Industrial</strong> – the Sectors or Divisions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The highest authority within the union is the <strong>CWA Convention</strong>, where delegates
          from every district and sector vote on constitutional amendments, policy resolutions, and officer
          elections.
        </p>

        <p>
          Between conventions, the <strong>CWA Executive Board</strong> governs the union’s affairs. The
          Executive Board is composed of the President, Secretary-Treasurer, and Vice Presidents from each
          District and Sector.
        </p>

          2. Two Structural Axes: Districts and Sectors
        </h2>

        <p>
          CWA operates on <strong>two parallel structural axes</strong> that intersect at the Executive Board:
        </p>

        <table class="cs-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Axis Type</th>
              <th>Leadership</th>
              <th>Represents</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Geographic Districts 1–7</td>
              <td>District Vice Presidents (regionally based)</td>
              <td>
                Members organized by <strong>location</strong> (telecom, public employees, media, etc.)
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Industrial Sectors / Divisions</td>
              <td>Sector Vice Presidents</td>
              <td>
                Members organized by <strong>industry or occupation</strong>, regardless of location
                (e.g., AFA-CWA, NABET-CWA, IUE-CWA, TNG-CWA, PHEW-CWA)
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          These two systems intersect only at the <strong>CWA Executive Board</strong>, where District and
          Sector Vice Presidents meet as equals under the National President and Secretary-Treasurer.

          3. CWA Districts — Regional Governance and Support
        </h2>

        <h3>Purpose and Representation</h3>

        <p>
          CWA’s <strong>seven geographic districts</strong> provide regional representation, administration,
          and coordination for all CWA-chartered locals within defined territories:
        </p>

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li><strong>District 1</strong> — Northeast (NY, NJ, New England)</li>
          <li><strong>District 2-13</strong> — Mid-Atlantic (PA, MD, DC, VA, WV)</li>
          <li><strong>District 3</strong> — Southeast (GA, FL, AL, TN)</li>
          <li><strong>District 4</strong> — Midwest (IL, IN, MI, OH, WI)</li>
          <li><strong>District 6</strong> — Southwest (TX, OK, AR, MO, KS)</li>
          <li><strong>District 7</strong> — Mountain States (CO, UT, MT, ND, SD, WY)</li>
          <li><strong>District 9</strong> — Western States &amp; Hawaii (CA, NV, HI, GU)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each District elects a <strong>Vice President</strong> who sits on the CWA Executive Board and
          oversees local unions in that region.
        </p>

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
          4. CWA Sectors — Industry-Based Representation
        </h2>

        <h3>Definition</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Sectors</strong> represent occupational or industrial groups across all geographic areas.
          Examples include:
        </p>

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li><strong>AFA-CWA</strong> – Association of Flight Attendants</li>
          <li><strong>NABET-CWA</strong> – Broadcast Employees &amp; Technicians</li>
          <li><strong>IUE-CWA</strong> – Industrial Division</li>
          <li><strong>TNG-CWA</strong> – The NewsGuild</li>
          <li><strong>PHEW-CWA</strong> – Public, Health, and Education Workers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each sector has its own <strong>constitution, bylaws, and internal elections</strong>, consistent
          with the overarching CWA Constitution (Article XIII).
        </p>

        <h3>Sector Leadership</h3>

        <p>
          Every sector elects its own <strong>Sector Vice President</strong>, who serves as a
          <strong>voting member</strong> of the CWA Executive Board. This ensures parity between
          geographic (District) and industrial (Sector) representation in national decision-making.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 5. AFA-CWA Sector -->
      <section class="cs-report__section">
        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
          5. The AFA-CWA Sector
        </h2>

        <p>
          The <strong>Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA-CWA)</strong> is a
          <strong>sector</strong>—not a district—within CWA, operating parallel to geographic districts and
          reporting directly to the national level.
        </p>

        <h3>Structural Hierarchy</h3>

        <p><strong>AFA Governance Chain</strong></p>

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li>
            <strong>Local Councils (LECs)</strong> represent flight attendants at individual bases.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Master Executive Councils (MECs)</strong> coordinate system-wide operations at each
            airline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AFA International</strong> consolidates all airline MECs and reports directly to the
            <strong>CWA National Union</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The <strong>AFA International President</strong> also serves as <strong>Sector Vice President</strong>
          on the CWA Executive Board.
        </p>

        <p>
          AFA therefore functions <strong>autonomously</strong> in operations and governance, while remaining
          <strong>financially and constitutionally integrated</strong> within CWA.

        <p>
          Districts and sectors are financed through <strong>per-capita dues remitted upward</strong> from
          local unions. AFA’s path can be summarized as:
        </p>

        <p>
          District offices are <strong>funded entirely</strong> from CWA National’s general treasury, not by
          direct dues collection. Each District Vice President’s office receives an
          <strong>annual operating budget</strong>, <strong>staff allocations</strong>, and
          <strong>field-support funds</strong> approved by the Executive Board.

          Although <strong>AFA-CWA is not governed by any District</strong>, it collaborates with District
          offices in several ways:

        <ul class="cs-report__list">

          9. The “Union of Unions” Model
        </h2>

        <p>
          CWA functions as a <strong>federated system</strong>, balancing
          <strong>sector autonomy</strong> with <strong>national accountability</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li>
            Each sector retains its own officers, budgets, and bargaining authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            The CWA Constitution ensures <strong>financial integrity</strong> and
            <strong>shared governance</strong> through the Executive Board and Convention.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This design allows specialized unions—such as AFA—to maintain professional focus while
          benefiting from CWA’s legal, political, and organizing infrastructure.
