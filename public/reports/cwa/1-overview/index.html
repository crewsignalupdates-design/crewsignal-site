    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is a federated labor union representing
      hundreds of thousands of members across multiple sectors and crafts in the United States
      and Canada. It operates as a union of unions, combining geographically based districts
      with industry-specific sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) functions within this structure as a
      national industrial sector. Unlike most CWA affiliates, AFA is not organized through
      CWA’s geographic district system. Instead, it operates through a carrier-based,
      nationwide governance model designed to reflect the operational realities of the
      airline industry.

    <h2>Historical Context</h2>
    <p>
      The Association of Flight Attendants was founded in 1945 as an independent organization
      representing airline cabin crew during the early expansion of commercial aviation.
      Over subsequent decades, AFA developed a governance structure centered on
      carrier-specific representation and system-wide coordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2004, AFA affiliated with the Communications Workers of America. That affiliation
      preserved AFA’s internal constitution, representational pipeline, and bargaining
      architecture, while situating the organization within CWA’s broader constitutional
      framework. The result was a hybrid model: an autonomous, industry-specific sector
      operating inside a larger international union.
