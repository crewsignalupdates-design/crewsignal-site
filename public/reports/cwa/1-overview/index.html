  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    This report series provides a structured overview of the Communications Workers of America (CWA)
    as a federated labor organization, and explains how flight attendant representation through the
    Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) operates within that broader constitutional framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    CWA is a union of unions, representing hundreds of thousands of members across multiple sectors
    and crafts in North America. AFA functions as a national sector within this federation, with its
    own internal governance model that differs in important ways from CWA’s geographic district system.

  <p class="cs-note">
    The sections that follow examine this structure in detail, focusing on how authority, funding,
    and representation are organized for flight attendants.
