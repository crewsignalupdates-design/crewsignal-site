      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is a federated labor union representing
        hundreds of thousands of members across multiple sectors and crafts in the United States
        and Canada. It operates as a union of unions, combining geographically based districts
        with industry-specific sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) functions within this structure as a
        national industrial sector. Unlike most CWA affiliates, AFA is not organized through
        CWA’s geographic district system. Instead, it operates through a carrier-based,
        nationwide governance model designed to reflect the operational realities of the
        airline industry.

            <p>
        The Association of Flight Attendants was founded in 1945 as an independent organization
        representing airline cabin crew during the early expansion of commercial aviation.
        Over subsequent decades, AFA developed a governance structure centered on
        carrier-specific representation and system-wide coordination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2004, AFA affiliated with the Communications Workers of America. That affiliation
        preserved AFA’s internal constitution, representational pipeline, and bargaining
        architecture, while situating the organization within CWA’s broader constitutional
        framework. The result was a hybrid model: an autonomous, industry-specific sector
        operating inside a larger international union.
