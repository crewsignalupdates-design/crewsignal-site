      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This series provides a modular, source-first reference explaining how flight attendant representation through the
        Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) operates within the constitutional and structural framework of the
        Communications Workers of America (CWA).
      </p>
      <p>
        CWA is a union of unions representing hundreds of thousands of members across multiple sectors and crafts.
        AFA functions as a national sector within this federation, with its own internal governance model that differs
        in important ways from CWA’s geographic district system.

        <li><strong>Governance and representation:</strong> how representation flows LEC → MEC → International.</li>
