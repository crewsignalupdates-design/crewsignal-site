    <h2>1. The Core Principle</h2>
    <p>
      CWA’s dual structure (districts and sectors) is sometimes misunderstood as two separate governance systems.
      It is not. Both districts and sectors derive authority from — and remain subject to — the
      <strong>CWA Constitution</strong>. This constitutional framework establishes what districts and sectors may do,
      how leadership is selected, how disputes are handled, and what oversight mechanisms exist.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-note">
      This section is intentionally structural and constitutional. It describes the rules of the system
      before any historical or performance evaluation.

    <h2>2. What “Autonomy” Means Inside CWA</h2>
    <p>
      In CWA usage, “autonomy” does not mean independence. It means that a sector or affiliate may retain
      internal governance and operational control over defined functions (often bargaining, internal elections,
      and industry programs) <em>within</em> the broader constitutional authority of CWA.
    </p>

      <h3>Working definition</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Autonomy inside CWA</strong> means internal control over defined functions (structure, elections,
        programs), while remaining subject to constitutional governance, convention authority, and oversight powers.

    <h2>3. Constitutional Authority Over Districts</h2>
    <p>
      Districts are geographic governance units within CWA. Their authority typically includes administrative
      oversight and political coordination, and their leadership is established through CWA-defined rules.
      District authority is bounded by the constitution and by the specific functions districts were created to perform.

    <h2>4. Constitutional Authority Over Sectors</h2>
    <p>
      Sectors exist to concentrate industry-specific expertise and bargaining strategy. Many sector functions
      appear “autonomous” because sectors often develop specialized legal, safety, and bargaining programs.
      But sector activity remains subject to the CWA constitutional framework — including governance rules,
      convention authority, and oversight mechanisms.
