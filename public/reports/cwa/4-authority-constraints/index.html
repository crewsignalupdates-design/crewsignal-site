    <h2>1. The Core Principle</h2>
    <p>
      CWA’s dual structure (districts and sectors) is often mistaken for two separate systems.
      It is not. Both districts and sectors ultimately derive authority from — and remain subject to —
      the <strong>CWA Constitution</strong>. This constitutional framework defines what districts and
      sectors may do, how leadership is selected, how disputes are handled, and what oversight mechanisms
      exist.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-note">
      This section is intentionally structural and constitutional. It describes the rules of the system
      before any historical or performance evaluation.

    <h2>2. What “Autonomy” Means Inside CWA</h2>
    <p>
      In CWA usage, “autonomy” does not mean independence. It means that a sector or affiliate may retain
      internal governance and operational control over specific functions (often bargaining, internal elections,
      and industry programs) <em>within</em> the broader constitutional authority of CWA.
    </p>

    <div class="cs-block cs-block--callout">
      <h3>Working definition</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Autonomy inside CWA</strong> means internal control over defined functions (structure, elections,
        programs), while remaining subject to constitutional governance, convention authority, and oversight powers.

    <h2>3. Constitutional Authority Over Districts</h2>
    <p>
      Districts are geographic governance units within CWA. Their authority typically includes administrative
      oversight and political coordination, and their leadership is established through CWA-defined rules.
      District authority is not unlimited; it is bounded by the constitution and by the specific functions districts
      were created to perform.

    <h2>4. Constitutional Authority Over Sectors</h2>
    <p>
      Sectors exist to concentrate industry-specific expertise and bargaining strategy. Many sector functions
      appear “autonomous” because sectors often develop specialized legal, safety, and bargaining programs.
      But sector activity remains subject to the CWA constitutional framework — including governance rules,
      convention authority, and oversight mechanisms.

    <h2>5. Why This Matters for AFA</h2>
    <p>
      AFA’s day-to-day operation appears highly autonomous because it is a national, industry-specific structure with
      its own internal governance, programs, and representational pipeline. However, AFA is still an affiliate operating
      within CWA’s constitutional governance framework.

      use later when comparing models, responsiveness, and accountability.
