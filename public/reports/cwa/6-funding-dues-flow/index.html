    <h2>1. The Foundational Detail</h2>
    <p>
      AFA dues are currently <strong>$50 per month</strong>. Critically, AFA dues are
      <strong>not a percentage of gross wages</strong> — a defining feature of AFA’s model.
      Unlike most unions where dues scale with income, AFA uses a flat-rate approach.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-note">
      This section focuses on structure and flow. Detailed verification using LM filings is handled in the Filings collection.

    <h2>2. Dues Flow Upward</h2>
    <p>
      Dues flow upward from local councils to AFA–CWA and then to CWA National via per-capita structures.
      While exact allocations can vary by policy and time period, the distribution is commonly described in approximate ranges.

    <h2>3. Why Retention Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Retention ranges matter because they shape the capacity of each layer to respond to member needs. Local retention affects
      day-to-day representation. AFA retention affects national bargaining and industry programs. CWA retention funds national infrastructure,
      organizing, and political power.
    </p>
    <p>
      This report series will later compare how different unions allocate resources across local representation, national bargaining, and
      enforcement capacity — using primary filings wherever possible.

    <h2>4. Verification Path</h2>
    <p>
      The most direct verification tools for funding and expenditures are the Department of Labor LM filings:
      <strong>LM-2</strong> (larger organizations), <strong>LM-3</strong>, and <strong>LM-4</strong> (smaller organizations).
      CrewSignal will maintain a dedicated filings library with direct links and summarized extracts.
