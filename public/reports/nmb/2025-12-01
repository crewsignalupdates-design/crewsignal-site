      <p>
        This report does <em>not</em> reproduce an official “monthly docket schedule” from the
        NMB; the Board does not publish a forward-looking calendar of expected actions.
        Instead, Crew Signal provides a projected outlook for December 2025 based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>United–AFA and other union bargaining calendars;</li>
        <li>published NMB contingency plans during the current appropriations lapse;</li>
        <li>recent NMB determinations and case history in 2025; and</li>
        <li>historical patterns in how the Board sequences mediation and representation work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because federal appropriations for the NMB have lapsed, public posting of new
        docket entries and formal mediation sessions may remain delayed or suspended even
        where underlying activity is continuing behind the scenes.

              NMB’s lapse-in-appropriations plan anticipates an orderly shutdown of most
              operations during a funding lapse, including <strong>suspension of mediation
              sessions</strong> and a pause in website updates. Only a limited set of “excepted”
              functions (such as support for any active Presidential Emergency Board) continue
              on a reduced basis. As a result, publicly visible mediation and representation
              activity is expected to remain muted in December unless Congress restores funding.

              The NMB website is expected to display a shutdown banner and may not post new
              Weekly Activity Reports, determinations, or mediation schedules until funding is
              restored. Any underlying party submissions or informal contacts with NMB staff
              may not appear on the public docket until after normal operations resume.

              Mediation case <strong>A-14065</strong> remains the active NMB file for the
              United–AFA flight attendant negotiations. The docket was opened in
              <strong>December 2023</strong>, with the mediator reassigned to
              <strong>Michael Kelliher</strong> in late 2024. No new public docket entries are
              expected in December unless funding is restored and the Board resumes regular
              case handling.

              AFA’s negotiations calendar lists a United–AFA bargaining session for
              <strong>December 9–12, 2025</strong>, with additional dates extending into early
              2026. Following the October 29–31, 2025 session—held
              <em>without</em> an NMB mediator due to the shutdown—these December dates are
              expected to proceed as union–management bargaining whether or not a mediator is
              present.

            <td>Mediator Participation</td>

              During the federal funding lapse, NMB guidance provides that
              <strong>mediation sessions are suspended</strong> except for narrow, excepted
              scenarios. In October, AFA reported that the scheduled United–AFA session
              proceeded without NMB participation because of the shutdown. Unless
              appropriations are restored in time, mediated involvement in the
              <strong>December 9–12</strong> session is <strong>uncertain</strong> and may remain
              limited to background communication rather than formal, on-site mediation.

              No specific United–AFA docket actions (such as proffer of arbitration or release
              from mediation) have been publicly signaled for December. The most realistic
              December outcomes are:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  continuation of direct bargaining between United and AFA; and

                <li>
                  preparatory work by the mediator and parties, timed to resume formal
                  mediation once appropriations are in place.

            <td>
              The NMB has already addressed the question of accretion for United’s
              <em>Assistant Manager – Aircraft Inspection (Outside Vendor)</em> positions,
              finding them within the <strong>IBT Mechanics &amp; Related</strong> craft/class
              and dismissing the application after accretion. United’s motion for
              reconsideration was denied in <strong>April 2025</strong>, closing that avenue of
              challenge. No further Board action on this issue is expected in December absent a
              new filing.

              No United–IBT representation or accretion matters are currently expected to be
              addressed by the NMB in December. Any IBT-related activity is more likely to
              arise from direct bargaining or internal union processes rather than new NMB
              docket entries.

              representation activity occurred in earlier years (2022–2023). Unless a new
              application is filed, no JetBlue-related determinations are anticipated for
              December.

              JetBlue is expected to remain off the active NMB representation docket for
              December 2025. Monitoring will continue, particularly for any filings related to
              ongoing strategic relationships or network changes that might trigger single-carrier
              analyses in the future.

              In <strong>March–June 2025</strong>, the NMB issued single-carrier findings and
              follow-on certifications for multiple Alaska–Hawaiian crafts and classes,
              including <strong>AFA Flight Attendants</strong>. While those decisions do
              not directly involve United or JetBlue, they serve as recent benchmarks for
              airline labor scope, consolidation, and the timing of representation actions.
              Implementation-related filings may continue to appear as the combined carrier
              structure is finalized.

              For United–AFA, the Alaska–Hawaiian cases provide context rather than immediate
              procedural consequences. They illustrate how the Board has approached scope and
              representation questions in a merging carrier environment that may inform future
              strategy discussions but are not expected to generate December docket steps for
              United or JetBlue.

              This December outlook is a forward-looking analysis built from public
              information and known procedural norms. The NMB does not publish an official
              “monthly docket schedule” for upcoming actions. Actual case timing may differ
              from expectations, especially while the Board’s operations are constrained by
              federal funding lapses or other external factors.
