        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Why Governance Matters to Contract Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Governance determines who can set bargaining priorities, who can approve tentative language, and how disputes
          move from frontline intake to a final resolution forum. Those choices influence drafting priorities (what gets
          defined tightly versus left to interpretation), enforcement pathways (what is expected to resolve locally versus
          what must be escalated), and cadence (how quickly bargaining, communications, and ratification can move given
          internal approvals and voting rules). CrewSignal treats governance as part of contract architecture because the
          same contract language can behave differently depending on authority boundaries, documentation standards, and
          escalation routing.

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Governance Map: Who Decides What</h2>
        <p>
          Exact names and authority boundaries vary by union constitution/bylaws and the bargaining context. The map
          below describes common bodies and typical decision scopes to help readers understand how drafting and enforcement
          responsibilities are distributed.
        </p>

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Members:</strong> Provide priorities, participate in defined votes (including ratification where applicable),
            and supply the facts and documentation that make enforcement actionable.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Local councils, locals, or base units:</strong> Often handle representation intake, early-step issue processing,
            member communications, and local documentation quality control.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>System councils or MEC-style bodies:</strong> Often coordinate airline-wide priorities, standardize enforcement
            posture across locations, and allocate resources for system-wide issues.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>National or international leadership:</strong> Often provides staff infrastructure (communications, research,
            training, policy administration) and holds defined constitutional authority for specific approvals and coordination.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Negotiating committees:</strong> Develop proposals, conduct bargaining, draft tentative language, and commonly
            provide a recommendation on whether a tentative agreement should proceed to the next internal gate.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Contract enforcement and grievance committees:</strong> Support case development (records, timelines, precedent),
            advise on settlements versus escalation, and help maintain consistency across similar disputes.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>System-level dispute forums:</strong> Many agreements rely on structured steps culminating in a system board,
            arbitration, or other final forum. Resourcing and case-selection practices can affect backlog and time-to-resolution.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Parent/subordinate structures where applicable:</strong> Some governance models include subordinate organizations
            within a parent union. In those cases, defined authority boundaries can matter for bargaining mandates, finance, and
            enforcement escalation (for example, CWA-AFA as a subordinate within CWA).

            <strong>Tentative agreement approval gate:</strong> whether a negotiating committee recommendation is advisory only or must be approved

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">How Governance Shows Up in Contract Text</h2>
        <p>
          Governance does not determine contract language by itself. However, certain contract-architecture features are commonly observed alongside
          different internal decision structures and enforcement workflows. These examples are descriptive and do not claim causation.
        </p>

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Definitions and cross-references:</strong> tighter definitions and clear internal references can support consistent interpretation
            when enforcement responsibilities are distributed across multiple representative layers.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Self-executing remedies:</strong> automatic pay/credit triggers based on objective conditions can reduce reliance on discretionary
            approval steps to obtain correction.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Timelines and documentation standards:</strong> filing windows, response deadlines, and required record formats often align with how
            committees intake, evaluate, and escalate cases.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Escalation mechanics:</strong> explicit step ladders, completeness requirements, and handoff criteria can reflect how governance structures route
            disputes from local handling to system-level handling.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Settlement authority and precedent handling:</strong> language that clarifies who can settle, how settlements are documented, and whether
            they set precedent can matter for enforcement consistency across locations.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Side-letter control and revision discipline:</strong> numbering, publication expectations, sunset terms, and incorporation practices affect how
            reliably frontline users can identify the controlling rule at a given time.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Data access and verification clauses:</strong> where included, audit/data access and reporting obligations can support enforcement when disputes depend
            on scheduling, payroll, or assignment records.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This page is structural analysis only. It is not legal advice, not bargaining guidance, and not a prediction of outcomes.
          Contract meaning and enforceability depend on the controlling language, the applicable procedures, and the facts of a specific situation.
