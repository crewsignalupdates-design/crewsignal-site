    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Scope &amp; Method</h2>
    <p>
      This review applies the CrewSignal Contract Analysis Criteria to the flight attendant collective bargaining agreement
      between American Airlines and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA).
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis evaluates the contract as written, focusing on structural clarity, enforceability, and operational reliability.
      It does not assess bargaining intent, negotiation strategy, or legal outcomes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">I. Structural Clarity</h2>
    <p>
      The APFA agreement is organized in a largely logical and navigable manner, with clear separation between definitions,
      scheduling rules, pay provisions, and enforcement mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amendments and updates are generally integrated without fracturing the underlying structure, reducing the need for excessive
      cross-referencing during time-sensitive operational events.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Structurally strong and usable under pressure.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">II. Rule Construction &amp; Precision</h2>
    <p>
      Core provisions rely primarily on mandatory language and defined triggers. Conditional logic is typically closed, with outcomes
      specified rather than deferred to later interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with most large legacy-carrier agreements, complexity increases in scheduling-adjacent sections, but ambiguity is generally bounded
      rather than open-ended.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Above-average precision with manageable complexity.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">III. Burden Allocation</h2>
    <p>
      The agreement generally places initial compliance obligations on the company rather than requiring constant affirmative action by the
      flight attendant to preserve rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automatic protections are more common than silent forfeiture, and defaults tend to preserve pay or legality unless explicitly conditioned.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Balanced and comparatively member-protective.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">IV. Enforcement Pathway</h2>
    <p>
      Many remedies are clearly defined, with identifiable violations and specified pay protections. While some outcomes still require procedural
      follow-through, enforcement pathways are visible rather than opaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contract avoids relying solely on grievance initiation to trigger basic protections, reducing operational risk to individual flight attendants.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Moderate to strong enforcement reliability.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">V. Internal Consistency</h2>
    <p>
      Core concepts such as reassignment, duty limitations, and pay protection are treated consistently across sections, minimizing internal conflict
      and interpretive drift.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Strong internal coherence.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">VI. Operational Reality Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      The agreement reflects the realities of a large, network carrier with mobile crews, reserve and lineholder distinctions, and integration with
      federal duty and rest frameworks.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Well-aligned with real-world operations.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">VII. Transparency &amp; Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      While dense, the contract uses consistent terminology and a predictable organizational structure that allows engaged members to locate and
      apply provisions without extraordinary effort.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Above-average accessibility for a legacy-carrier agreement.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Structural Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>Key strengths:</strong><br />
      Clear architecture, predictable burdens, visible enforcement pathways
    </p>
    <p><strong>Structural weaknesses:</strong><br />
      Complexity inherent to scale; some process-dependent remedies
    </p>
    <p><strong>High-risk zones:</strong><br />
      Scheduling edge cases during irregular operations
    </p>
    <p>
      This agreement serves as a useful baseline for comparing multi-carrier representation models and alternative drafting approaches.
