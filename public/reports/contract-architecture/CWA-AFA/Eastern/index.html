        This page analyzes the Tentative Agreement reached between Eastern Airlines and
        Flight Attendants represented by CWA-AFA. The agreement constitutes a first
        collective bargaining agreement following National Mediation Board certification
        on June 28, 2022. The analysis reflects the architecture of the Tentative Agreement
        as presented for ratification and does not assume final adoption.

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The Eastern Tentative Agreement reflects a compact, first-contract architecture
        designed for a small-to-mid-size carrier operating in charter and supplemental
        markets. The agreement is conventionally structured, with clear section demarcation,
        low cross-reference density, and limited layering of exceptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Management rights are broadly reserved, with substantive protections appearing
        primarily as enumerated carve-outs rather than as tightly constrained defaults.
        This structure is typical of first contracts, particularly where bargaining power
        asymmetries remain pronounced.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling provisions establish bid lines, reserve availability periods, duty limits,
        rest requirements, and notification standards. The Company retains discretion over
        line construction and assignment, subject to defined procedural requirements and
        minimum guarantees.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reserve architecture relies on defined Reserve Availability Periods (RAPs) with
        explicit contact and report windows. While this provides baseline predictability,
        protections are primarily procedural rather than prohibitive, and enforcement
        depends on accurate classification and timely notification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The Tentative Agreement establishes a seventy (70) hour minimum monthly guarantee,
        hourly pay progression over the agreement term, premium pay for working on days off,
        and defined deadhead credit. Pay construction is straightforward, with limited
        stacking or valuation complexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Payroll timing, correction mechanisms, and underpayment remedies are explicitly
        stated, contributing to administrative clarity. The economic framework emphasizes
        predictability over upside, consistent with a first-contract posture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The agreement provides for a formal grievance procedure culminating in a System
        Board of Adjustment with a neutral arbitrator. Just-cause standards apply to
        discipline and discharge for non-probationary Flight Attendants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certain scope-related disputes are eligible for expedited arbitration, a notable
        feature for a first contract. However, remedies are predominantly retrospective,
        and interim relief mechanisms are limited.
      </p>

    <!-- 6. Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        As a first Tentative Agreement, Eastern’s contract establishes baseline economic
        and procedural protections while leaving significant discretion with management.
        Its strengths lie in clarity, enforceability pathways, and the formal recognition
        of Flight Attendant rights under the Railway Labor Act.
      </p>

      <p>
        The agreement’s principal limitations are structural: broad management rights,
        limited automatic remedies, and reliance on post-violation enforcement. These
        features are consistent with early-stage collective bargaining outcomes.
      </p>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="standardized-scorecard">
      <h2>Standardized Contract Scorecard</h2>

      <p class="cs-note">
        This agreement is a Tentative Agreement pending ratification. Comparative
        scoring will be published following ratification and confirmation of the final,
        effective collective bargaining agreement.

    <!-- 8. Context Notes -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="context-notes">
      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        Eastern represents a first-contract benchmark within the CWA-AFA portfolio.
        Its architecture will be most analytically useful when compared against other
        first agreements and against legacy carriers operating under long-amendable
        contracts.
