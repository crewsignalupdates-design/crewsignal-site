    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        The Air Wisconsin Flight Attendant Agreement is a mid-length regional-carrier contract negotiated during
        a disruption-heavy period and now operating well beyond its amendable date. While the agreement contains
        numerous defined rules and procedural protections, its architecture reflects a pre-pandemic operational
        model that has not been substantively modernized.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Status note:</strong> This agreement has been amendable since October 1, 2022, yet remains the
        governing framework for current operations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The Air Wisconsin agreement is structurally detailed and rule-dense, with extensive procedural specificity
        across scheduling, reserve utilization, and pay crediting. Unlike highly modular contracts, many provisions
        operate through layered conditions, exceptions, and interaction between sections rather than through
        closed, self-executing logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Management Rights are asserted broadly and early (Section 3), with subsequent sections functioning primarily
        as carve-outs from that baseline authority. This creates an architecture where protections exist, but are
        frequently contingent on compliance with process, timing, and classification requirements.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> The agreement relies heavily on procedural enforcement rather than structural
        constraint to protect Flight Attendant interests.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling rules are extensive and highly specific, covering bid line construction, relief lines, reserve
        categories (including Ready Reserve), drafting limits, reroutes, resequencing, critical flying, and open time
        assignment. Many protections are clearly articulated, such as caps on drafting frequency and defined reserve
        call-out windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the Company retains broad authority to designate open flying, critical flying, and operational
        adjustments. Numerous provisions require Flight Attendants to actively assert rights (e.g., requesting
        adjustments, calling scheduling, disputing awards within short windows) to preserve protections.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> High rule density with meaningful protections, but significant reliance on
        Flight Attendant vigilance and procedural compliance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The economic architecture is relatively robust for a regional carrier. Monthly guarantees are set at
        seventy (70) hours for both lineholders and reserves, with multiple rigs in effect, including duty rigs,
        trip rigs, minimum daily pay, drafting pay at time-and-a-half, and holiday premiums.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, pay construction is complex, with non-pyramiding rules, numerous conditional premiums,
        and distinctions between scheduled, actual, and credited time. While this allows for reasonable earnings
        stability, it also increases opacity and the likelihood of payroll disputes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> Economic protections are solid on paper, but enforcement and verification
        burdens fall disproportionately on individual Flight Attendants.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The agreement contains a formal grievance procedure with defined timelines, investigation rights, and access
        to a System Board of Adjustment. Importantly, failure by the Company to meet grievance timelines results in
        the grievance being granted, while Union failure results in denial (Section 4.F).
      </p>

      <p>
        Grievance mediation is available by mutual agreement, and arbitration costs are shared. While the structure
        is procedurally sound, remedies are typically retrospective, and there are limited interim protections
        during disputes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> The enforcement framework is formally balanced, but slow-moving and
        reactive rather than preventative.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Strengths / Weaknesses / Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        Air Wisconsin’s agreement reflects a highly negotiated regional-carrier contract with detailed work rules,
        respectable pay guarantees, and a comprehensive scheduling framework. Its strengths lie in specificity and
        the breadth of covered scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its primary weaknesses are architectural age and over-reliance on process. Many protections require active
        enforcement by Flight Attendants, and the agreement lacks the modular, self-executing constraints seen in
        more modern CBAs. The extended amendable status further weakens leverage and reliability.
