    <!-- 1. Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        This agreement reflects a regional-carrier bargaining environment with a conventional, article-based structure
        designed for operational use. Core economic mechanics (pay/credit) and expenses appear early, followed by hours
        of service, lineholder scheduling controls, and a dedicated reserve subsystem—then benefits, seniority, and enforcement.
      </p>
     </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The Horizon Air agreement is structurally modular. It clusters economic rules, legality limits, and assignment systems
        into discrete subsystems rather than relying on dense cross-referencing. This architecture generally reduces interpretive
        load during time-sensitive decision-making (awards, legality questions, irregular operations).
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to more exception-heavy agreements, Horizon’s architecture is oriented toward clarity: users can identify
        the governing subsystem first (lineholder vs reserve; pay vs legality) and then apply specific triggers and remedies.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> Predictability is structurally higher when triggers and classifications are applied consistently,
        but outcomes can still hinge on correct procedural steps (especially within reserve and reassignment mechanics).
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling controls are concentrated in the lineholder scheduling article and a dedicated reserve article.
        Reserve operates as a full subsystem (reserve categories, standby/availability concepts, assignment ordering),
        which supports coverage variability while increasing the importance of procedural compliance.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical Lens:</strong> Agreements with a robust reserve subsystem can be operationally clearer, but they also tend to
        generate more “rule-bound” disputes—where the key question is whether steps were followed precisely and on time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The economic framework relies on defined pay/credit drivers and premium constructs rather than broad discretionary policy language.
        This supports auditability and post-flight verification, but edge cases can turn on “greater of” calculations and non-duplication logic
        where multiple credit concepts intersect.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The agreement’s economic design can produce reliable outcomes if the credit rules are applied consistently to actual operations,
        including irregular operations where scheduled/actual deltas become material.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution Architecture -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution-architecture">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement follows the standard airline model: defined grievance steps culminating in arbitration/System Board mechanisms.
        Structural strength is determined less by the existence of process and more by whether timelines and remedies create deterrence
        versus primarily corrective outcomes after delay.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural asymmetry:</strong> As in many agreements, the burden of initiation and persistence often rests on the employee side unless
        the contract contains meaningful time-bound consequences for noncompliance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="structural-strengths-weaknesses-and-comparative-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> subsystem clarity (pay, legality, lineholder scheduling, reserve) improves navigability and operational usability.
        <br />
        <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> as with many regional agreements, practical force may depend on post-violation correction rather than self-executing constraints,
        especially during irregular operations.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Domain</th>
      <th>Score</th>
      <th>Rationale</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>I. Structural Clarity</td>
      <td>3 / 5</td>
      <td>
        The agreement is modular and subsystem-oriented, with clear separation between pay, legality,
        lineholder scheduling, and reserve. This improves navigability, though some concepts still require
        cross-referencing across articles.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>II. Rule Construction &amp; Precision</td>
      <td>3 / 5</td>
      <td>
        Core rules are generally well-defined and operationally usable, but precision varies by section.
        Some provisions rely on conditional language that shifts outcomes to procedural compliance rather
        than substantive guarantees.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>III. Burden Allocation</td>
      <td>2 / 5</td>
      <td>
        The burden of invocation and enforcement largely rests with the flight attendant. Protections
        exist, but many require affirmative action, timely challenge, or post-event correction to be
        realized.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>IV. Enforcement Pathway</td>
      <td>2 / 5</td>
      <td>
        A conventional grievance and System Board structure is present, but timelines and remedies are
        primarily corrective rather than deterrent. Structural incentives favor resolution after delay.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>V. Internal Consistency</td>
      <td>3 / 5</td>
      <td>
        The agreement is internally coherent, with definitions generally applied consistently across
        subsystems. Some tension remains between baseline protections and exception-driven provisions.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VI. Operational Reality Alignment</td>
      <td>3 / 5</td>
      <td>
        The contract reflects real-world regional operations and provides usable frameworks for reserve
        coverage and irregular operations. Practical outcomes still depend on strict procedural adherence.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>VII. Transparency &amp; Accessibility</td>
      <td>3 / 5</td>
      <td>
        The agreement is readable and structured in a way that supports line-level use, though complexity
        increases in high-friction scenarios such as reassignment and irregular operations.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Total</strong></td>
      <td><strong>19 / 35</strong></td>
      <td>
        Architecturally functional with moderate clarity, but enforcement power and burden allocation
        limit the reliability of protections in practice.
      </td>

        This score evaluates contract architecture and enforceability characteristics as written within a regional-carrier operating environment.
        It does not measure bargaining intent or effort; it focuses on structural reliability, clarity, and enforceability pathways.
