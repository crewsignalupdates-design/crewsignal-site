      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        The Horizon Air Flight Attendant agreement is a regional-carrier contract organized in a conventional
        article-based structure. It places core work rules and economic mechanics early, followed by scheduling
        systems (lineholder and reserve), then benefits, seniority, and enforcement. Compared to many smaller
        agreements, it is relatively comprehensive, with defined subsystems for reserve and scheduling that are
        designed to be operationally applied rather than treated as aspirational policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Source note: This analysis is based on the Horizon Air Flight Attendant Contract covering May 1, 2020
        through April 30, 2024.

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The agreement’s architecture is “system-forward”: it defines pay/credit rules, expenses, hours of service,
        then locates the lineholder scheduling and reserve frameworks as discrete control layers. This improves
        navigability during time-sensitive events (awards, reassignments, legality questions) because users can
        identify the governing subsystem before drilling into exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implication: The contract is structured to support operational decision-making, but outcomes can still depend
        on careful classification (lineholder vs reserve) and proper trigger identification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Scheduling controls are concentrated in the lineholder article and a dedicated reserve article. The reserve
        subsystem is comparatively rule-dense (reserve categories, callout/standby, assignment ordering) and is
        designed to manage coverage variability. The lineholder scheduling architecture relies on award logic and
        open time processes, with protections expressed as defined limits and procedural steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytical lens: Strong subsystem separation improves usability; enforcement reliability depends on clear triggers
        and consistent application by scheduling and payroll.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The pay/credit framework is designed around defined credit drivers and premium constructs rather than heavily
        discretionary “policy” language. This supports auditability, but also means edge cases require careful attention
        to the “greater of” calculations and non-duplication rules where applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key insight: The agreement’s economic model is structurally capable of producing predictable credit outcomes,
        but only if the credit rules are applied consistently to actual operations (including irregular operations).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution-architecture">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Enforcement follows the standard airline labor pattern: defined grievance steps culminating in System Board
        mechanisms. Structural strength is determined less by the existence of process and more by (a) clarity of
        violations and (b) whether remedies are self-executing or require sustained procedural follow-through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Structural takeaway: The enforcement pathway is present and recognizable; practical strength depends on how
        quickly disputes can be advanced and whether delay is structurally rewarded.
