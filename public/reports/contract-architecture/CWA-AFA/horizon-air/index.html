    <p>Contract Architecture Analysis</p>

    <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>
    <p>
      Horizon Air’s agreement reflects a regional-carrier bargaining environment with a conventional article-based
      structure and a comparatively systems-forward organization: core pay/credit and expenses appear early, followed
      by scheduling systems (lineholder and reserve), then benefits, seniority, and enforcement.

    </p>

    <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The agreement is modular: it separates economic rules (credit/premiums), legality limits (hours of service/rest),
      and assignment systems (lineholder vs reserve) into distinct clusters. This reduces interpretive load relative to
      highly cross-referenced agreements and supports time-sensitive operational use.
    </p>

    <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Scheduling controls are concentrated in the lineholder scheduling article and a dedicated reserve article.
      Reserve operates as a full subsystem (categories/standby/assignment ordering), improving clarity but increasing
      the importance of procedural compliance.
    </p>

    <h2>Economic Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The pay/credit framework relies on defined credit drivers and premium constructs rather than broad discretionary
      policy language. This supports auditability, but edge cases can turn on “greater of” calculations and non-duplication
      logic.
    </p>

    <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Enforcement follows the standard airline pattern: grievance steps culminating in arbitration/System Board mechanisms.
      Structural strength depends on whether remedies are timely and deterrent versus primarily corrective after delay.
    </p>

    <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>
    <p>
      Strength: clear subsystem separation (pay, legality, lineholder scheduling, reserve) improves navigability and operational usability.
      Comparative flag: as with many regionals, practical force may depend on post-violation correction rather than self-executing constraints,
      especially during irregular operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Context Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This analysis reflects contract architecture and enforceability characteristics within a regional-carrier environment.
      It does not measure bargaining intent or effort; it evaluates structural strength and reliability as written.
