    <!-- 1. Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        A regional-carrier agreement with a conventional article structure and a relatively modular layout: pay/credit and expenses early,
        hours of service next, then distinct lineholder and reserve subsystems, followed by benefits, seniority, and enforcement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Structurally “system-forward”: the agreement clusters economic rules, legality limits, and assignment systems into discrete subsystems,
        improving navigability and reducing cross-reference load relative to exception-dense contracts.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> Predictability rises when triggers and classifications are applied consistently, but outcomes can still hinge on procedural compliance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Scheduling architecture is split cleanly between lineholder rules and a dedicated reserve subsystem; reserve is rule-dense and operationally explicit,
        improving clarity but increasing the importance of “step compliance.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Credit and premium constructs are explicit and generally auditable; edge cases depend on “greater of” calculations and non-duplication logic where multiple drivers intersect.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution Architecture -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution-architecture">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Standard grievance/System Board model; structural leverage depends on whether timelines and remedies deter violations versus correcting them after delay.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="structural-strengths-weaknesses-and-comparative-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>
      <p>
        The contract’s main strength is modularity—users can locate governing subsystems quickly (pay vs legality vs lineholder vs reserve).
        The main weakness is typical of regionals: enforcement tends to be corrective after the fact, and protections can depend on timely, procedural invocation.
