    <p>Contract Architecture Analysis</p>

    <p>Effective Period: May 1, 2020 – April 30, 2024</p>

    <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>
    <p>
      This agreement reflects a regional-carrier bargaining environment with a conventional article-based structure and
      a comparatively “systems-forward” organization: core pay/credit and expenses appear early, with dedicated subsystems
      for scheduling (lineholder) and reserve, followed by benefits, seniority, and enforcement. It is designed to be
      operationally applied—supporting day-to-day decision-making during awards, legality questions, and irregular operations.

    <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Horizon Air agreement is structurally modular: it separates economic rules (credit and premium constructs),
      legality limits (hours of service/rest), and assignment systems (lineholder vs reserve) into distinct clusters.
      This improves navigability and reduces interpretive load relative to highly cross-referenced agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implication: The contract’s practical strength tends to come from subsystem clarity—outcomes are more predictable when
      triggers and classifications (lineholder vs reserve) are applied consistently by scheduling and payroll.
    </p>

    <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Scheduling and assignment rules are organized around defined lineholder processes and a dedicated reserve subsystem.
      Reserve is treated as a full operational control layer (categories/standby/assignment ordering), which supports coverage
      variability but requires careful compliance with procedural steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analytical lens: Subsystem separation improves usability; enforcement reliability depends on clear triggers and consistent
      application during reschedules and irregular operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Economic Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The economic framework is organized around defined pay/credit drivers and premium constructs rather than broad discretionary
      “policy” language. That supports auditability, but edge cases can turn on “greater of” calculations and non-duplication rules
      where multiple credits could apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key insight: Earnings reliability depends less on the presence of premiums and more on whether credit rules are applied
      consistently to actual operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The enforcement model follows the standard airline pattern: defined grievance steps culminating in arbitration/System Board
      mechanisms. The structural question is not whether a process exists, but whether remedies are timely and deterrent versus
      primarily corrective after delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Structural asymmetry: As in many agreements, the burden of initiation and persistence often rests on the employee side, while
      management can benefit from procedural delay unless timelines carry meaningful consequences.
    </p>

    <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>
    <p>
      Strengths: subsystem modularity (pay, legality, lineholder scheduling, reserve) improves navigability and supports operational use.
      Weaknesses: like many regionals, practical force can depend on post-violation correction rather than self-executing constraints,
      especially during irregular operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Context Notes</h2>
    <p>
      This score reflects contract architecture and enforceability characteristics within a regional-carrier operating environment.
      It does not measure bargaining intent or effort; it evaluates the structural strength and reliability of protections as written.
