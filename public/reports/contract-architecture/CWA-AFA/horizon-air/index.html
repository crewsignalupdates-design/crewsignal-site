    <!-- 1. Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>
      <p>
        This agreement reflects a regional-carrier bargaining environment with a conventional, article-based structure designed for operational use. Core economic mechanics and expenses appear early, followed by hours-of-service limits, lineholder scheduling controls, and a fully articulated reserve subsystem, with benefits, seniority, and enforcement addressed thereafter.

Unlike many regional agreements, the contract includes explicit successorship and merger-integration protections, as well as multiple sideletters that materially affect implementation and working conditions. In particular, an implementation sideletter governs phased effectiveness and programming oversight, while a dedicated hotel-standards sideletter establishes minimum requirements and a defined dispute-resolution pathway.
      </p>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Horizon Air agreement is architected as a modular system rather than an exception-dense hierarchy. Economic rules, legality limits, scheduling mechanisms, and reserve operations function as distinct subsystems, reducing cross-reference density and improving navigability during time-sensitive operational decisions.

Compared to legacy-carrier agreements, the architecture relies less on layered overrides and more on clearly bounded control systems. This design supports predictability in routine operations, though outcomes can still hinge on correct classification and procedural compliance in higher-friction scenarios.

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> Predictability rises when triggers and classifications are applied consistently, but outcomes can still hinge on procedural compliance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Scheduling and assignment are governed by layered control systems, including PBS for line construction, SAP for controlled schedule adjustments, and AV days as a pre-check-in cancellation and coverage mechanism. These systems operate within defined footprint and rescheduling boundaries, creating a structured approach to coverage management.

Reserve is treated as a full operational subsystem rather than a fallback category, with defined classifications, assignment ordering, and procedural constraints. This improves clarity and transparency but places significant weight on step-compliance, particularly during irregular operations and reassignment events.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The economic framework is built around explicit, trip-level “greater-of” credit drivers, including block time, duty-time percentages, and trip-time factors, supplemented by minimum daily guarantees. This structure is highly auditable and supports post-flight verification.

At the same time, intersecting credit concepts and non-pyramiding rules can reduce transparency in complex pairings, shifting some outcomes from straightforward calculation to interpretive application in edge cases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution Architecture -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution-architecture">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Enforcement follows a conventional grievance and System Board model, with limited self-executing remedies. Most economic and scheduling disputes are resolved retrospectively, and structural incentives tend to favor correction after delay rather than immediate deterrence.

Notably, certain scope-related and hotel-standards disputes are subject to expedited arbitration, providing faster resolution in defined areas. Outside these carve-outs, effective enforcement depends on timely invocation and sustained procedural follow-through.

    <!-- 6. Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="structural-strengths-weaknesses-and-comparative-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>
      <p>
        Structurally, the agreement’s principal strength lies in its modular design and unusually explicit scope-protection architecture for a regional carrier, including successorship language and controlled subcontracting concepts. These features enhance clarity and limit certain forms of operational circumvention.

The primary weakness mirrors that of many non-legacy agreements: enforcement power remains largely procedural, with meaningful protections often dependent on post-violation correction rather than automatic or deterrent mechanisms. Compared to agreements like Hawaiian, Horizon exhibits stronger subsystem clarity but similar limitations in enforcement leverage.
