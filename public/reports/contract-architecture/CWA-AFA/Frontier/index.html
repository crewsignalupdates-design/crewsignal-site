      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        Frontier’s 2019–2024 agreement is a modern “systems contract” built around defined scheduling logic,
        PBS, reserve transparency, and explicit duty/rest construction. Compared to many low-cost carrier CBAs,
        it is unusually explicit about auditability (Union access to crew scheduling systems and recorded phone lines),
        and it uses pay-based deterrence (premium add folder, junior assignment pay) as an operational control lever.

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Structurally, this agreement is highly modular: it separates Compensation, Hours of Service (crew legality),
        Scheduling, Reserve, and a dedicated enforcement stack (Grievance + System Board). The contract also contains
        an Addendum/LOA ecosystem that functions as a “maintenance layer,” including implementation timing and
        corrected/clarified language.
      </p>

      <p>
        The agreement is definition-driven and process-dependent. Many rights are enforceable because the contract
        provides (a) explicit timelines, (b) defined notification standards, and (c) audit trails (system access, recorded calls).
        Where it weakens is in edge-state flexibility: Declared Irregular Operations (DIO) and Management Rights allow
        broader operational discretion when the system is stressed.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> High enforceability potential due to transparency mechanisms, but outcomes depend on correct procedural framing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling design is one of Frontier’s strongest features. The agreement formalizes PBS bidding, bid-period
        timelines, line construction parameters, open time and trade processes, and defined reschedule/reroute limits.
        It also includes a formal “Schedule Integrity” concept outside DIO conditions, and defines AVA (Available to Assign)
        as a structured mechanism rather than an informal practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contract adds several enforceability upgrades that matter in practice: real-time union access to crew scheduling
        systems for compliance monitoring, recorded Crew Scheduling phone lines with retention and access rules, and explicit
        reserve assignment transparency through remote access to reserve availability data.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Strong scheduling protections + strong auditability. The main structural vulnerability is DIO relief and the process-dependence of AVA/reschedule/reroute pathways.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Frontier’s economic model combines hourly pay with a substantial rig framework and premium-based deterrence.
        The contract includes an average minimum duty-period credit (4:30), a trip rig (1 hour per 4.2 hours TAFB),
        a defined “greater of” comparison for trip valuation, and specific credits for CDO and Ready Reserve.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not purely a “rate table” agreement: the pay architecture is designed to stabilize earnings in normal operations
        and to deter staffing shortfalls through premium add folder (double time) and junior assignment pay (200%).
        A notable tradeoff is lineholder guarantee structure: reserves have a defined monthly guarantee, while lineholders
        rely more heavily on credit mechanics and bid outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> Strong credit mechanics and deterrence premiums, with moderate complexity and some asymmetry between lineholder and reserve pay certainty.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement architecture is formally complete: a defined grievance procedure with investigations/discipline standards,
        timelines, and escalation to a System Board of Adjustment. The agreement also includes expedited arbitration for certain
        recognition/scope disputes and a defined arbitrator panel process.
      </p>

      <p>
        What strengthens enforcement in practice is the contract’s “evidence stack”: recorded scheduling calls, union system access,
        and explicit documentation timelines. These features reduce information asymmetry and lower the burden of proof for
        structural violations (e.g., reschedule/reroute parameters, reserve assignment order, JA log compliance).
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Strong formal enforcement plus strong auditability. Remedies remain largely retrospective, but the record-building tools are unusually robust.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Strengths / Weaknesses / Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        Frontier’s agreement is a strong example of “enforceability by visibility”: union access to scheduling systems,
        recorded calls, a defined JA log, and reserve transparency all increase the practical value of negotiated rules.
        The scheduling and pay architecture also uses deterrence premiums (PAF, JA pay, long duty pay) to steer behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary weakness is that operational edge states (especially DIO) provide broader flexibility and can soften
        baseline protections. The agreement is also moderately complex: protections often require correct classification
        (AVA vs reserve, reschedule vs reroute, DIO vs non-DIO), and failures in process can shift outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Comparative flag:</strong> Frontier is likely to score unusually high on “Company discretion constraint” relative to peers because deterrence + auditability reduce discretionary drift—except during DIO conditions.

      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        Frontier’s low-cost operational model magnifies the value of enforceable scheduling rails and auditability.
        This agreement’s most distinctive comparative contribution is its transparency stack (system access + recorded calls)
        paired with deterrence premiums, which together reduce “practice drift” in normal operations.
