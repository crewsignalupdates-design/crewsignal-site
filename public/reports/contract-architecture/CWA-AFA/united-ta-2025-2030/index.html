      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This report examines the rejected Tentative Agreement between
        <strong>United Airlines</strong> and the <strong>Association of Flight Attendants–CWA</strong>
        that, if ratified, would have amended and superseded the existing United Flight Attendant Agreement for the period
        <strong>2025–2030</strong>. The Tentative Agreement did not take effect and therefore carries no binding legal force; it is analyzed
        here solely as a proposed modification to the existing contractual architecture. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The Tentative Agreement was negotiated against the backdrop of a legacy agreement characterized by extensive Letter-of-Agreement layering,
        procedural enforcement, and corrective-only remedies. As such, the TA does not operate as a clean-sheet rewrite. Instead, it proposes targeted
        adjustments to compensation, work rules, and selected processes while leaving the underlying structure largely intact. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This analysis evaluates the Tentative Agreement as written, comparing its proposed provisions to the existing agreement to determine what, if anything,
        would have materially changed for flight attendants had it been ratified.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Structurally, the 2025–2030 Tentative Agreement reflects an incremental modification strategy rather than a re-architecture of the United Flight Attendant contract.
        The proposal preserves the existing framework built around scheduling, reserve, pay/credit, and a traditional grievance/System Board model, while layering in revised
        economic terms and selective procedural refinements. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The TA’s design emphasis is economic recalibration and selective quality-of-life adjustments rather than reducing interpretive density or altering the corrective-only
        enforcement model. It does not propose a shift toward punitive remedies, self-executing constraints, or materially reduced assignment authority. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Implication Summary:</strong> If ratified, the Tentative Agreement would have operated as a value-adjusted continuation of the existing contract rather than a structural reset.
        Any benefits conferred would arise from improved economics or refined procedures, not from a fundamental redistribution of operational control or enforcement leverage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The Tentative Agreement does not propose a fundamental restructuring of United’s scheduling and assignment framework. Instead, it retains the existing architecture
        centered on the scheduling and reserve subsystems and associated Letters of Agreement that condition reassignment authority, reserve utilization, and irregular operations handling. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        At a structural level, the TA preserves broad Company assignment authority, procedural (rather than categorical) schedule protections, and a reserve system designed to absorb operational disruption.
        It does not introduce new self-executing limits on reassignment or materially narrow Company authority during irregular operations. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Analytical Lens:</strong> This is continuity with calibration, not reform. Any added value in this domain would arise from incremental improvements in clarity, timing, or compensation,
        not from a shift in who controls assignment decisions or how those decisions are enforced in real time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The most consequential changes proposed in the Tentative Agreement are economic rather than structural. The TA proposes increased pay rates and adjustments to selected premiums and overrides,
        raising the value assigned to work, disruption, and recovery flying within the legacy pay/credit framework. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        These changes primarily reallocate cost rather than control: Company flexibility remains substantially the same, while economic consequences for exercising that flexibility increase.
        Guarantees and credit floors continue to function as baseline protections, and the agreement’s “make-whole” logic becomes more valuable as underlying rates increase. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Had it been ratified, the Tentative Agreement would have delivered real economic gains, but those gains would have operated within the same scheduling,
        reserve, and enforcement architecture that governs today. It represents a value enhancement of the status quo rather than a redistribution of operational leverage.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The Tentative Agreement preserves the existing Railway Labor Act enforcement model: investigations, grievances, and a System Board of Adjustment.
        It does not introduce penalties, liquidated damages, or other punitive mechanisms that would deter violations prospectively. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Corrective, not punitive remedies:</strong> even where economic improvements increase the value of corrective remedies, enforcement remains limited to restoring pay, credit,
        or schedule position after the fact. There is no additional consequence imposed on the Company for violations beyond corrective relief. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural Takeaway:</strong> From an enforcement perspective, the TA represents continuity rather than recalibration. It improves potential remedy value through higher rates,
        but does not alter the underlying enforcement posture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural strengths:</strong> Material economic uplift layered onto an already comprehensive base agreement; changes are largely additive and numeric, making implementation and
        auditability more predictable; and the TA avoids re-architecting core scheduling/reserve systems in ways that could create unintended interpretive conflict. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural weaknesses:</strong> No redistribution of operational control; procedural dependency remains high; corrective-only enforcement is preserved; and overall structural complexity
        (including LOA layering) is not reduced. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Comparative flags:</strong> The TA is value-forward but structure-neutral: it increases what flight attendants would have been paid without materially changing when, why, or how they are
        required to absorb operational disruption.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="changes-relative">
      <h2>Changes Relative to the Existing Agreement</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This section evaluates the 2025–2030 Tentative Agreement solely on the basis of what would have changed had it been ratified, compared to the existing agreement.
        The analysis distinguishes between economic value changes, procedural refinements, and structural continuity.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>What would have changed:</strong> The most immediate and tangible change would have been higher economic value applied to existing work—higher base rates and adjusted premiums/overrides.
        Because United’s architecture resolves disruption through pay/credit rather than prevention, higher rates would also have increased the value of corrective remedies during reassignment,
        drafting, extensions, and recovery flying. Incremental procedural refinements would have clarified or updated certain timing and process elements, but would not have eliminated the need for active
        monitoring, acknowledgment, and documentation.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>What would not have changed:</strong> Scheduling and assignment authority, reserve burden, and the corrective-only enforcement posture would have remained substantially the same.
        The TA does not introduce new hard constraints, veto points, punitive remedies, or a material reduction in structural complexity.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Net effect:</strong> Flight attendants would have been paid more, but would not have been protected earlier or more automatically. The TA represents a measurable economic enhancement of the
        status quo rather than a redistribution of operational leverage.
