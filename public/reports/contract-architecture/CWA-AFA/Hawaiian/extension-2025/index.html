      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        This page is an “extension overlay” for Hawaiian’s 2020–2025 Flight Attendant Agreement. It is designed to be read
        alongside the baseline Contract Analysis page. The baseline analysis remains the authoritative architectural profile of the
        underlying CBA; this page isolates what the extension changes and quantifies the impact through a standardized score delta.

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The extension does not re-architect the underlying CBA. It preserves the core structure (PBS, reserve processes, pay/credit
        mechanics, dispute resolution) while modifying a limited number of sections and letters of agreement.
      </p>

      <div class="cs-note">
        <strong>Extension Overlay:</strong>
        <ul class="cs-list">
          <li>Term extension / duration change with amendable date moved to February 28, 2028.</li>
          <li>Targeted edits to Compensation, Reserves, Open Flying indicators, Safety time-off, Pandemic meet-and-confer, RHRA deadline, and System Board panel provisions.</li>
          <li>Replacement of Hawaiian profit-sharing language (Section 34-21) with Alaska Air Group PBP beginning plan year 2025 (payout in 2026).</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        The extension introduces modest scheduling transparency improvements and a targeted reserve rule modernization.
        These changes do not alter the overall scheduling architecture, but they do reduce friction in two common pain points:
        (1) reserve pick-ups on GDOs, and (2) visibility into open time “drop likelihood.”
      </p>

      <div class="cs-note">
        <strong>Extension Overlay:</strong>
        <ul class="cs-list">
          <li><strong>Reserve GDO pick-up:</strong> eligibility becomes tied to <em>actual rest</em> rather than a fixed “midnight” construct (i.e., earlier lawful pick-up if contractual rest is satisfied).</li>
          <li><strong>Open Flying indicators:</strong> adds red/black/green status coding (or equivalent) as a live indicator of reserve coverage and drop likelihood (explicitly not a guarantee).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The extension’s primary impact is economic: it adds wage increases and replaces the Hawaiian profit-sharing construct with
        Alaska Air Group’s Performance Based Pay Plan (PBP) beginning plan year 2025. It also adds participation in Alaska’s
        Operational Performance Rewards (OPR) program on the same basis as Alaska Flight Attendants.
      </p>

      <div class="cs-note">
        <strong>Extension Overlay:</strong>
        <ul class="cs-list">
          <li><strong>Wage increases:</strong> 6% at DOR (effective with April bid month), then 3% at DOR+1 and 3% at DOR+2.</li>
          <li><strong>Profit sharing replacement:</strong> Section 34-21 replaced effective January 1, 2025 with Alaska Air Group PBP (target payout 5% of eligible earnings); 2024 plan year remains under prior rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance rewards:</strong> participate in Alaska OPR (monthly/quarterly/annual awards; potentially $1,800 per plan year as summarized).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution Architecture -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The extension includes a targeted System Board revision (arbitrator panel) and adds an explicit “pandemic meet-and-confer”
        framework. The latter is a structural enforcement enhancement: it recognizes that a declared pandemic can constitute a change
        in working conditions requiring bargaining over effects, while preserving legally required implementation authority.
      </p>

      <div class="cs-note">
        <strong>Extension Overlay:</strong>
        <ul class="cs-list">
          <li><strong>Pandemic provisions:</strong> if CDC/WHO declares a pandemic that significantly impacts operations, the parties will immediately meet and confer to establish pandemic-related provisions (PPE, exposure notice, leaves, policy modifications, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>System Board:</strong> revises arbitrator panel provisions in Section 24.H.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        The extension is best understood as a “targeted uplift” rather than a rewrite. It increases economic value and adds a small
        number of operational and safety/enforcement improvements, while leaving the underlying complexity profile unchanged.
      </p>

      <div class="cs-note">
        <strong>Extension Overlay:</strong>
        <ul class="cs-list">
          <li><strong>Safety incident time off/pay protection:</strong> expands/clarifies paid time off without loss of pay/credit following incidents (including reserve removal provisions).</li>
          <li><strong>RHRA extension:</strong> extends the retiree health reimbursement arrangement deadline to April 2, 2026 (with the 60-day notice practical constraint noted after January 1, 2026).</li>
          <li><strong>Reserve >85 incentive:</strong> adds an LOA enabling 1.5x pay (not credit) for assigned flying above 85 hours in Company-designated bid months, while preserving the “no-fly over 85” right.</li>

      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        This extension overlay is intentionally narrow: it scores only what the extension changes. The base contract’s full
        scheduling and economic mechanics remain in force unless amended. The extension’s most material architectural effect is
        economic uplift (wages/PBP/OPR) and modest reserve/scheduling transparency improvements; it does not reduce contract
        complexity.
