    <!-- 1. Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        Hawaiian’s 2020 Flight Attendant Agreement is a large, enterprise-scale contract (hundreds of pages) built to
        govern multiple operating environments, including extensive international flying and Hawaii-specific operational
        realities. The agreement is organized as a comprehensive “systems contract,” with many protections expressed
        through defined terms, procedural tracks, and detailed pay/credit mechanics.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Structurally, the contract is highly sectional and definition-driven, with broad coverage across scheduling, reserves,
        PBS bidding mechanics, pay/credit, and operational contingencies. The agreement uses a layered approach: baseline
        rules, enumerated exceptions, and multiple “special case” provisions for disruptions, international operations, and
        unique flying patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        This design supports operational completeness, but increases interpretive load. Outcomes frequently depend on correct
        categorization (type of flying, duty status, disruption cause) and on procedural compliance (bids, self-assignment
        mechanics, notification rules).
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> This is a high-coverage, high-complexity agreement where protections are often real but not always self-executing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling architecture is deeply integrated with PBS, reserve constructs, and a broad set of definitions and procedural
        pathways. The contract is designed to handle both “normal operations” and disruption states through detailed policy logic,
        rather than relying on informal practice. This tends to increase predictability at scale but can be difficult to navigate
        in real-time during irregular operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reserve and self-assignment mechanisms are a critical structural axis of the agreement. The contract’s approach places
        significant emphasis on classification (reserve status, rest state, days off constructs) to determine what is permissible
        and what remedies apply.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Strongly systematized scheduling rules with meaningful protections, but high procedural dependency.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Hawaiian’s pay and credit architecture is sophisticated and multi-layered, including numerous premium triggers and multiple
        ways to value time (segment/duty/trip rigs and related mechanisms). Economic outcomes can be strong, particularly for
        flight attendants who understand the interaction between scheduling states and pay construction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tradeoff is complexity: crediting and premium provisions can be difficult to audit without detailed familiarity.
        This increases the risk that “paper protections” degrade into “enforcement by persistence,” especially where pay disputes
        depend on reconstructing procedural pathways after the fact.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> High upside economic design, paired with high verification burden.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The agreement’s enforcement strength is defined by formal procedure and the ability to route disputes into established
        adjustment mechanisms. However, many high-impact disputes in practice are “procedural disputes” (classification,
        notice, and sequencing) rather than simple rule violations, and the contract’s complexity can advantage whichever party
        controls records, classifications, and operational coding.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Enforcement is viable, but complexity increases friction and delay risk.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Strengths / Weaknesses / Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        Hawaiian’s 2020 agreement is a high-coverage systems contract. Its strengths include broad subject-matter coverage,
        detailed scheduling/procedural tracks, and sophisticated economic rules. Its weaknesses are primarily architectural:
        complexity, heavy reliance on categorization, and high interpretive load for line-level users.
      </p>

      <p>
        In cross-carrier comparisons, Hawaiian will often score well on “what exists in the text,” but may lose points on clarity
        and the self-executing nature of protections.
