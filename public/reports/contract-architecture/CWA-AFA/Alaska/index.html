    <!-- 1. Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        This agreement is a modern, procedure-driven architecture designed to operate reliably under irregular operations.
        Its protections and remedies are generally strong, but frequently depend on correct procedural classification
        (e.g., disruption type) and compliance with formal notice/contact mechanics.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The Alaska Airlines agreement is highly structured and modular, with clear segmentation between legality constraints,
        scheduling processes, and compensation outcomes. Rather than relying on a single generalized rule set, operational
        disruptions are routed into distinct procedural tracks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Precision is achieved through defined terms, enumerated triggers, and closed conditional logic. Cross-referencing is
        extensive but deliberate, reflecting a contract intended to function as an integrated system rather than a collection
        of standalone rules.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> The agreement is structurally rigorous and predictable once mastered, but cognitively demanding on first pass.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling protections are framed through explicit categories and defined triggers, with bounded discretion and
        pre-specified outcomes. The architecture prioritizes predictability and enforceability through formal rules rather
        than implied practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, preservation of rights frequently depends on procedural compliance—correct notice, method of contact, and
        acknowledgment mechanics. Misclassification of the governing procedural category is a recurring “high-risk zone”
        because it can determine which protections and remedies apply.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Strong protections and bounded discretion, with meaningful process-dependence at the line level.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The economic architecture is designed to support reliability through defined pay protections and valuation comparisons.
        Remedies and pay outcomes tend to be consistent once the governing procedural track is correctly identified.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because pay protections are often keyed to classification and procedural steps, the economic system rewards accurate
        framing and discourages informal interpretation. This increases predictability but raises the navigational burden
        during disruptions.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> Economic reliability is strong, but it is coupled to procedural correctness.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement pathways are explicit, with defined pay protections, default outcomes, and structured comparisons that
        reduce reliance on informal practice. Remedies are generally reliable once the procedural category is correctly identified.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary enforcement weakness is not absence of remedy, but the risk of procedural missteps (notice/contact mechanics,
        disruption classification) that can alter eligibility or the remedy track.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Strong remedies contingent on accurate procedural framing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Strengths / Weaknesses / Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        This agreement illustrates a “disciplined systems contract” model: explicit defaults, strong definitions, bounded discretion,
        and reduced reliance on practice. It provides a useful counterpoint to principle-based agreements by showing how formal
        structure can substitute for custom and operational discretion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its tradeoff is complexity. Accessibility is below average without experience, and protections can become process-dependent
        during irregular operations where time and clarity are scarce.

        This score reflects contract architecture and enforceability characteristics within a procedure-driven agreement model.
        It does not measure bargaining intent or effort, but rather the structural strength and reliability of negotiated protections as written.
