    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The PSA Airlines Flight Attendant Agreement represents a <strong>mature, rule-dense regional architecture</strong>
        negotiated in the late-2010s, prior to the post-2020 labor market tightening that reshaped later agreements.
        It is structurally comprehensive, procedurally explicit, and designed to manage a high-interaction scheduling
        environment through defined processes rather than categorical prohibitions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The agreement places significant emphasis on <em>predictability through structure</em>.
        Scheduling, reserve utilization, junior assignment, and reassignment are all governed by layered rules,
        sequencing requirements, and documentation obligations. Management discretion is preserved,
        but it is routed through formalized pathways that are observable and grievable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contract also reflects AFA’s long-standing regional priorities: strong days-off protections,
        defined reserve call-out standards, minimum day pay, and detailed premium constructs,
        combined with a robust grievance and System Board framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Implication summary:</strong> PSA’s agreement is best understood as a <em>procedural-control model</em>.
        Its strength lies in how thoroughly it specifies processes, ordering, and limits.
        Its relative vulnerability lies in the fact that remedies are largely retrospective,
        and some flexibility is preserved to maintain operational continuity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling architecture is one of the defining features of this agreement.
        Line construction, blending, reserve utilization, open time handling, and junior assignment
        are governed by detailed, interlocking provisions rather than general principles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Minimum days-off requirements are explicit (eleven for lineholders, ten for reserves),
        with restoration mechanisms when junior assignment or blending erodes those minima.
        “Golden Days” introduce immovable off-day protection for reserves,
        further limiting discretionary reassignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reserve system is highly engineered:
        long-call, short-call, and ready reserve are treated as distinct subsystems,
        with defined RAPs, conversion limits, bucket-based assignment ordering,
        FOLO preferences, and transparency requirements via electronic posting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Irregular Operations (IROP) are formally declared, bounded in scope,
        and paired with notice and termination requirements,
        reducing ambiguity during extended disruptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> PSA relies on <em>process density</em> to manage flexibility.
        Protections are strongest where rules are explicit and sequencing is enforced;
        they are weaker where discretion is preserved but documented rather than prohibited.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The economic architecture centers on a <strong>75-hour monthly guarantee</strong>,
        supplemented by minimum day pay (3.5 hours), deadhead credit,
        and a series of targeted premiums rather than broad multipliers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compensation mechanisms include:
        junior assignment pay at 150%,
        early report and extension premiums,
        holiday/critical coverage pay,
        instructor overrides, and defined training credits.
        These elements are designed to reinforce scheduling discipline
        without creating highly variable pay outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> PSA’s pay structure prioritizes <em>stability and auditability</em>.
        When flexibility is required, the cost is defined and predictable,
        but not escalatory to the degree seen in later regional agreements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The agreement contains a comprehensive enforcement framework:
        investigatory safeguards, representation rights,
        defined timelines, grievance review meetings,
        mediation prior to arbitration, and a standing System Board of Adjustment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crew Scheduling communications are recorded and retained,
        with access rights for the Union when disputes arise,
        materially strengthening enforceability in scheduling-related grievances.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Enforcement power is primarily procedural and retrospective,
        but the density of rule construction improves the likelihood of successful remedies
        when violations occur.

      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Structural strengths:</strong> Dense and internally consistent scheduling rules;
        strong days-off protections; highly developed reserve architecture;
        defined premium constructs; recorded scheduling communications;
        and a complete grievance and System Board framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Structural weaknesses:</strong> High cognitive load;
        reliance on procedural compliance;
        remedies that are largely time-delayed rather than self-executing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Comparative flags:</strong> This agreement reflects a pre-2020 regional equilibrium.
        Readers should expect later contracts to exhibit tighter discretion constraints
        and more aggressive premium leverage.
