      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This analysis examines the collective bargaining agreement between
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> and the
        <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</strong>,
        effective during the 2016–2021 amendable period and remaining in force under the Railway Labor Act pending modification or supersession.
        The agreement governs a globally deployed flight attendant workforce operating across domestic, international, and military charter flying,
        and reflects one of the most complex and layered contract architectures in the U.S. airline industry.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        United’s agreement is structurally distinctive for its scale, legacy depth, and modular sprawl.
        It combines a comprehensive base agreement with an extensive set of Letters of Agreement (LOAs)
        addressing reserve rotation, international purser structures, technology implementation, scope protections,
        and operational carve-outs negotiated across multiple bargaining eras.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement operates under the Railway Labor Act with a traditional grievance and System Board framework,
        supplemented by specialized and expedited pathways embedded throughout the LOAs.
        Scheduling, pay, duty, and rest provisions are distributed primarily across Sections 6, 7, and 8,
        requiring cross-referencing to understand how reassignment authority, legalities, and pay protection interact in practice.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This contract functions as a <strong>baseline legacy reference</strong> within the CrewSignal Contract Architecture series.
        Later tentative agreements and proposals are best understood as layered modifications to this structure
        rather than clean-sheet redesigns.
      </p>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        United’s Flight Attendant Agreement represents one of the most structurally complex labor architectures in the industry.
        It is the product of successive bargaining cycles, operational mergers, and problem-solving through LOAs
        rather than wholesale restructuring.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement prioritizes coverage and specificity over modular clarity.
        Nearly every operational scenario is addressed somewhere in the contract corpus,
        but often across multiple sections or stand-alone agreements rather than within a single consolidated framework.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Sections 6 (Minimum Pay, Credit, and Legalities), 7 (Scheduling), and 8 (Reserve Scheduling Procedures)
        form the operational spine of the agreement, but are frequently conditioned by LOAs that introduce exceptions,
        pilot programs, or transitional rules.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Implication Summary:</strong>
        United’s contract offers broad and often deep protections, but those protections are embedded in a dense,
        layered architecture that places a premium on institutional knowledge and procedural navigation.
        Its strength lies in accumulated coverage; its structural vulnerability lies in interpretive friction
        and reliance on after-the-fact correction rather than self-executing constraints.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        United’s scheduling system operates through interlocking regimes that distinguish between lineholders and reserves,
        domestic and international flying, and routine versus irregular operations.
        Assignment authority is extensive but procedurally bounded.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        For lineholders, the agreement begins from a premise of schedule ownership.
        Section 7.Q governs loss of flight time and reassignment, requiring notice within defined timeframes
        and offering structured options depending on when the disruption occurs.
        Reassignment authority is coupled with pay protection rather than categorical prohibitions.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The reserve system is highly engineered and assignment-forward.
        Reserves absorb a significant share of operational disruption,
        with protections expressed primarily through guarantees, rest provisions, and credit limits
        rather than veto rights.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Analytical Lens:</strong>
        United prioritizes coverage and recoverability over simplicity.
        Protections exist, but they are procedural and must be actively preserved through correct notice,
        acknowledgment, and documentation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        United’s economic architecture is designed to absorb operational variability through layered pay and credit mechanisms.
        Minimum duty rigs, trip rigs, guarantees, drafting pay, holding time, and position-specific overrides
        convert disruption into defined compensation outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement relies heavily on “greater-of” logic, applying whichever calculation is most favorable
        among scheduled time, actual time, duty minimums, and trip rigs.
        This increases fairness and auditability but adds complexity.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
        United manages flexibility economically rather than restrictively.
        Where scheduling authority exists, it is frequently paired with defined pay and credit consequences
        rather than front-end prohibitions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Enforcement follows a traditional Railway Labor Act grievance and System Board structure,
        supported by investigation rights, timelines, and representation safeguards.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Scheduling communications are recorded and retained, providing critical evidentiary support
        where disputes depend on the content and timing of Company communications.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Corrective, not punitive remedies:</strong>
        When contractual violations occur, enforcement is limited to pay adjustments, credit restoration,
        or schedule correction after the fact. There is no punitive mechanism that imposes penalties on the Company,
        even when flight attendants’ contractual rights are violated.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural Takeaway:</strong>
        The agreement depends on procedural enforcement and documentation rather than deterrence.
        Its effectiveness turns on grievance discipline and institutional follow-through.
      </p>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Strengths:</strong>
        Exceptional breadth of coverage, layered economic protection, evidentiary access through recordings,
        and scalability for a global operation.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
        High interpretive density, procedural dependency, retrospective remedies,
        and significant cognitive load during irregular operations.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Comparative Flags:</strong>
        This is a legacy, coverage-dense architecture that prioritizes correction over constraint
        and procedure over modular clarity.
