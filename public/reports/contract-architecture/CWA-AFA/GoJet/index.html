        This page analyzes the Tentative Agreement reached between GoJet Airlines and
        Flight Attendants represented by CWA-AFA. The agreement reflects a renegotiated
        successor contract to the prior 2020–2025 agreement and incorporates revised
        economic terms, updated scheduling language, and new Letters of Agreement.

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The GoJet Tentative Agreement is a classic regional-carrier systems contract:
        highly procedural, definition-driven, and organized around formal scheduling
        logic (PBS), reserve structures, and explicit management rights with negotiated
        carve-outs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to many legacy agreements, the contract is internally consistent and
        readable, but enforcement depends heavily on correct classification (reserve vs
        lineholder, extension vs junior assignment, reassignment vs cancellation) and
        on documentation retained through Company systems.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling is built around PBS with defined bid timelines, minimum days off,
        reserve availability periods (RAPs), and a structured order of assignment.
        The agreement codifies junior assignment, extensions, premium pay trips,
        and Golden Days as distinct mechanisms rather than informal practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        A notable structural feature is transparency: Union access to Crew Management
        systems and recorded scheduling calls materially strengthens auditability,
        particularly for disputes involving rescheduling, reserve utilization, and
        reassignment pay.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The TA introduces revised hourly pay rates effective August 16, 2025 with
        scheduled increases through 2029, alongside a seventy-five (75) hour monthly
        guarantee, minimum day pay, CDO credit, boarding pay (with conditional
        implementation), and multiple premium pay triggers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pay architecture is moderately complex but coherent: most premiums are paid
        above guarantee, and reschedule/reassignment pay is calculated on a trip-by-trip
        basis, reducing fragmentation in pay disputes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement provisions are comprehensive for a regional agreement, including
        just-cause discipline standards, defined grievance timelines, and a System Board
        of Adjustment with a standing arbitrator panel.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with many CWA-AFA regional contracts, remedies remain largely retrospective,
        but the availability of recorded evidence and structured escalation pathways
        improves practical enforceability relative to thinner agreements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        The GoJet TA’s primary strengths are clarity, internal consistency, and a
        relatively complete enforcement framework. It establishes predictable
        scheduling rails and economic outcomes while avoiding extreme fragmentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The principal weaknesses are familiar: broad management rights language,
        process-dependent protections, and limited forward-looking remedies during
        irregular operations.

      <h2>Standardized Contract Scorecard</h2>

      <p class="cs-note">
        This agreement is a Tentative Agreement pending ratification. Comparative
        scoring will be published following ratification and confirmation of the

    <!-- 8. Context Notes -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="context-notes">
      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        GoJet serves as a useful comparator for other regional CWA-AFA agreements,
        particularly in assessing first-order improvements achieved through
        successor bargaining versus legacy stagnation at larger carriers.
