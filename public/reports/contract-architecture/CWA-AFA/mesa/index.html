    <!-- 1. Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        This agreement governs Mesa Airlines Flight Attendants under the Railway Labor Act and is structured as a
        procedure-forward regional contract with unusually explicit scope and successorship architecture. The
        Recognition, Scope &amp; Successorship section includes anti–alter ego language, system flying protections,
        and a defined merger/seniority integration framework referencing Allegheny-Mohawk/LPP concepts and current
        law principles, with expedited arbitration available for disputes alleging violations of the successorship
        provisions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Mesa’s contract is architected as an operating system: it relies on dense definitions, explicit timelines,
        and rule-bounded scheduling and pay mechanics rather than broad standards. The result is a contract that is
        comparatively deterministic—outcomes are predictable when triggers and procedures are followed—while placing
        meaningful compliance burdens on users during irregular operations and schedule modification.
      </p>

      <p>
        Architecturally, the agreement’s “control points” are (1) scope/successorship protections, (2) a highly
        specified scheduling stack (PBS, schedule enhancement logic, SAP, reserve), and (3) auditable pay/credit
        drivers including “greater-of” constructs (scheduled vs actual, guarantee overlays, and premium triggers).
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> The contract favors predictability through process, but practical protections depend on technical compliance and timely invocation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling is layered: PBS constructs and awards monthly lines, known absences are applied pre-bid, and a
        Schedule Enhancement Software framework governs drops, swaps, trades, and adds, subject to explicit legality
        constraints and buffer logic. A defined Schedule Adjustment Period (SAP) provides a seniority-based window
        for whole-trip changes, and post-SAP transactions are constrained by time windows and operational rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reserve is a full subsystem with defined call-out minimums, reserve shift structures, ready reserve rules,
        aggressive reserve bidding windows, and a utilization model that time-balances reserves until prorated
        guarantees are met, then shifts to seniority-based “call me first/call me last” style sequencing.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Structural clarity is high, but real-world outcomes hinge on procedural compliance during SAP, reserve utilization, and irregular operations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The economic architecture emphasizes auditability: Flight Attendants are paid the greater of actual or scheduled
        hours flown segment-by-segment, with a bid period minimum guarantee (including separate reserve treatment and
        reserve day credit values). The agreement defines premium constructs for junior assignment/involuntary extension
        and ties premium valuation to either a fixed multiple or the contemporaneous open-time offering, creating a
        market-referenced premium trigger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pay protection mechanisms extend into displacement/IOE drop scenarios, cancellation pay, equipment changes, and
        scheduled-versus-actual reconciliation against the line guarantee. However, intersecting guarantees, premium overlays,
        and non-duplication logic can reduce transparency in complex months, particularly when schedules are heavily modified.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> The pay system is strong and auditable in baseline use, but complexity rises materially in modified schedules where multiple guarantees and premiums intersect.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution Architecture -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution-architecture">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement follows a conventional grievance pathway with defined filing windows, monthly hearing cadence, written
        decision requirements, and escalation to a System Board of Adjustment with a neutral panel structure. The agreement
        contains explicit time-limit consequences (withdrawal with prejudice for union delay; automatic denial/appeal for company
        delay in certain cases), but remedies remain primarily corrective rather than self-executing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notably, disputes alleging violations of the successorship/merger integration protections may bypass early grievance steps
        and proceed to expedited arbitration with accelerated hearing and decision timelines, increasing structural leverage for
        scope-related enforcement compared to routine scheduling/pay disputes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Enforcement pathways are detailed and time-bounded, but most remedies are retrospective; expedited handling is strongest in scope/successorship disputes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="structural-strengths-weaknesses-and-comparative-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        Mesa’s core strength is procedural completeness: the agreement specifies a full scheduling stack (PBS, SAP, enhancement
        rules, reserve utilization) alongside auditable pay drivers and explicit premium triggers, reducing ambiguity when applied
        correctly. A comparative strength for a regional carrier is the explicit scope and successorship architecture coupled with
        expedited arbitration for alleged violations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The principal weakness is complexity-to-enforcement mismatch: the contract’s procedural density increases cognitive and
        compliance burden while most disputes remain corrected after the fact. In practice, protections are strongest when they are
        mechanically triggered and weakest where outcomes depend on discretionary exceptions or post-event enforcement.
