      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        This agreement is a compact, plain-language collective bargaining agreement covering Flight Attendants at
        Air Transport International (ATI). It is structurally lean relative to major-carrier agreements, with low
        cross-reference density and comparatively few layered exceptions. The contract’s core strengths are clarity,
        predictability, and an enforcement system that is unusually well-defined for its size.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Source note:</strong> This analysis is based on the 2025–2029 ATI Flight Attendant Agreement. (See cover page and Section 16.)
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        ATI’s agreement follows a straightforward sectional design: recognition and scope, definitions, scheduling and reserve,
        compensation and benefits, travel/expenses, vacations, training, leaves, seniority, furlough/recall, general provisions,
        and a dedicated investigations/grievance/arbitration section. Because the contract is short and generally self-contained,
        most outcomes can be determined without extensive cross-walking across multiple articles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tradeoff for this clarity is that some protections are less “systematized” than in larger agreements. Rather than
        complex procedural tracks and layered remedies, the contract relies on direct rules, defined premium payments, and a
        grievance process designed to move disputes to a System Board when necessary.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> The agreement is highly navigable, but its overall protective strength depends heavily on how
        broad management rights and operational discretion are interpreted in practice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling protections are expressed through concrete, operational rules: report and release standards, duty and rest
        constructs, bid line posting and award timelines, open time processes, trade rules, reserve contact/response requirements,
        and a defined junior assignment/extension framework. This architecture is more “rules-forward” than “policy-forward” and
        is therefore relatively accessible to line-level users.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the agreement expressly reserves the Company’s right to change operations and scheduling practices based on
        business judgment, subject to notice and effects bargaining. This creates a structural tension: day-to-day rules are
        clear, but the Company retains meaningful discretion to alter scheduling practices in ways that can reshape the operating
        environment.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Strong baseline clarity and several concrete protections, tempered by a broad operational-change lever.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        ATI’s economic architecture emphasizes readability and reliability. The Bid Unit Guarantee is explicitly stated as 56 hours,
        with pay calculated as the greater of the guarantee or credited hours. Live flying credits on a one-for-one basis using the
        greater of scheduled or actual block time. Deadhead credit is generally one-for-two, with specific rules for company aircraft,
        commercial international segments, and surface transportation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Premium and additional compensation provisions are enumerated rather than heavily layered: junior assignment/extension
        premium above guarantee, aircraft cleaning premium, passenger-onboard delay credit, and a check flight attendant premium.
        Payroll procedures include an explicit mechanism for timely correction of pay shortages above a threshold, supporting
        enforceability and trust in the pay system.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> The agreement is not optimized for maximum upside, but it is structurally strong in transparency
        and payment reliability once credit rules are applied.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The enforcement system is one of the agreement’s strongest architectural components. Discipline is governed by just cause,
        written notice requirements, and an investigation framework that permits representation. Grievances are defined as disputes
        over interpretation or application of the agreement, must be filed within a specified window, and proceed through defined
        meeting and decision steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Importantly, if the Company fails to hold a hearing or issue a decision within the prescribed time limits, the grievance is
        treated as denied and automatically advances to the System Board. This mechanism reduces the incentive to delay and
        improves procedural reliability. The agreement also includes an expedited arbitration pathway for certain scope-related
        disputes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Clear timelines plus automatic advancement reduce enforcement inertia and strengthen
        the practical value of negotiated rights.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Strengths / Weaknesses / Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        ATI’s agreement is a strong example of a “compact contract” model: relatively short, direct language, low cross-reference
        burden, and a pay system that is easy to audit. Its enforcement section is comparatively well-designed, including a default
        pathway that advances disputes when time limits are missed. These characteristics support line-level usability and reduce
        ambiguity-driven friction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The principal structural weakness is the breadth of management rights and operational discretion. While many day-to-day rules
        are clear, the Company reserves authority to change terms not specifically provided for, and to change operations and scheduling
        practices subject to effects bargaining. This can reduce the stability of protections over time and shift key outcomes into
        policy space rather than contract space.

      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        ATI operates in a cargo/charter environment with heavy reliance on deadheading, irregular operations, and customer-driven
        flying. This agreement’s architecture prioritizes readability and enforceable process over layered economic systems. Scores
        reflect contract structure as written, not bargaining intent or external market constraints.
