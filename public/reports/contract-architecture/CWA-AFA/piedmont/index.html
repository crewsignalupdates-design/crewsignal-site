      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The Piedmont Airlines Flight Attendant Agreement reflects a <strong>modern, rule-dense regional carrier architecture</strong>,
        negotiated in the post-pandemic environment and shaped by both operational recovery pressures and
        long-standing AFA regional bargaining priorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Structurally, the agreement prioritizes <em>predictability, procedural constraint, and auditable enforcement</em>.
        Rather than relying on broad management discretion with after-the-fact remedies, the contract embeds
        detailed rules governing line construction, reserve utilization, reassignment, premium flying, and junior assignment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The agreement also exhibits a high degree of <strong>modularity</strong>: scheduling, reserve, open time,
        premium trips, and hours-of-service constraints are treated as distinct but interoperable subsystems,
        reducing ambiguity at operational stress points.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Implication summary:</strong> Piedmont’s agreement is designed to operate under continuous operational pressure.
        Its strength lies not in isolated benefits, but in a tightly integrated rule system that limits discretion,
        preserves days off, and converts disruptions into defined pay and credit outcomes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling protections are among the strongest structural features of this agreement.
        Lines are built within defined credit bands, with hard minimum days-off guarantees and
        explicit limits on duty periods, block hours, and trip construction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Open flying, 48-hour adjustment windows, reserve assignment ordering, and premium trip designation
        are all governed by explicit formulas rather than ad hoc discretion.
        The contract further requires documentation, logging, and recorded communications for scheduling actions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Junior assignment (drafting) is tightly constrained:
        capped annually and monthly, subject to ordering rules, and paired with premium pay and notice requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> This is a constraint-forward scheduling system.
        Flexibility exists, but it is bounded, sequenced, and compensated.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Piedmont’s economic architecture centers on a <strong>75-hour monthly guarantee</strong>,
        augmented by detailed minimum-day rules, deadhead credit, holiday pay,
        premium trip compensation, and targeted stipends.
      </p>

      <p>
        Premium trips are not discretionary bonuses; they are triggered by defined staffing thresholds
        and paid above guarantee using a transparent formula tied to days worked beyond the bid award.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> The pay system reinforces the scheduling architecture.
        When the Company needs flexibility, the cost is explicit and predictable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The grievance and System Board framework is comprehensive and procedurally disciplined.
        Electronic filings, read-receipt confirmation, mediation prior to arbitration,
        and defined timelines reduce procedural drift.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scope and seniority disputes receive expedited handling,
        signaling their structural importance within the agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Enforcement power is primarily procedural rather than immediate,
        but the depth of rule clarity significantly improves grievance viability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Dense rule construction, strong days-off integrity,
      explicit premium trip mechanics, junior assignment caps, and high modular clarity.</p>

      <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Complexity may increase cognitive load;
      enforcement remains retrospective rather than self-executing.</p>

      <p><strong>Comparative flags:</strong> This agreement reflects a mature AFA regional pattern
      emphasizing control and predictability over broad discretion.</p>
