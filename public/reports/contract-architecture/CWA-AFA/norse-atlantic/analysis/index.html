        This update focuses on what changed in the 2025–2028 agreement compared to the 2022–2024 first agreement:
        where protections improved, where the structure stayed the same, and where drafting or tradeoffs create new risk.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

      <p>
        The 2025–2028 agreement is not a full architectural rewrite. The core “regulation-anchored” model remains intact
        (EASA definitions supply the legality spine; the contract supplies pay/credit rules, responsibility allocation, and an RLA dispute path).
        The biggest gains appear in compensation architecture (rates, per diem window, non-flying credit, and allowances),
        and in operational quality-of-life standards (hotel requirements, inflight rest facility expectations, base closure protections).
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Top improvements</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item"><strong>Per diem improved:</strong> higher hourly rate and paid from check-in to check-out (not just departure to arrival).</li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item"><strong>Non-flying credit improved:</strong> baseline three (3) block hours for most non-flying events, with additional credit for long standby/trainings/meetings.</li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item"><strong>QoL and stability:</strong> explicit hotel-room standards, upgraded inflight rest facility expectations, and base-closure protections with notice and benefit maintenance options.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Key continuity</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item"><strong>Regulatory anchoring remains:</strong> EASA/Authority definitions still drive duty/rest/legality.</li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item"><strong>Scheduling spine remains stable:</strong> 12-day-off floor and published schedule protection framework remains central.</li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item"><strong>Enforcement remains conventional:</strong> grievance + System Board pathway still largely retrospective/time-delayed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Primary risk / unfinished subsystem</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          <strong>Reserve protections remain incomplete:</strong> the agreement still defers bidding and reserve provisions to future “meet and negotiate,”
          and the pay article explicitly excludes reserve (as an example of non-duty) from pay/credit treatment.

      <p class="cs-report__footnote">
        This table highlights structural changes and operational impact signals, not bargaining intent.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="pay-and-credit">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Pay, Credit, and Economic Architecture</h2>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Hourly pay scale</h3>
      <p>
        The 2025–2028 agreement increases the pay scale across steps and continues annual increases through 2027.
        The monthly guarantee remains 60 block hours, and the agreement adds pay protection for flying lost through no action of the CCM.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Per diem (rate and duty-window coverage)</h3>
      <p>
        The per diem change is one of the most consequential improvements because it both increases the rate and expands
        the paid window to include pre-departure and post-arrival duty time (check-in through check-out).
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Non-flying events</h3>
      <p>
        The new agreement moves toward a more unified “non-flying events” architecture. The baseline credit is higher,
        and long standby/trainings/meetings receive additional credit. The agreement also explicitly closes certain stacking paths
        by excluding pay/credit when a non-flying event shares a duty period with flying.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Allowances</h3>
      <p>
        The 2025–2028 agreement adds recurring allowances (uniform maintenance and communication) and updates alternate
        transportation support via a company match in the reimbursement program.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="legalities-and-scheduling">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Legalities, Scheduling, and Operational Reliability</h2>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Roster transparency</h3>
      <p>
        A notable clarity improvement is the requirement that all hours of duty be accurately reflected on the roster,
        including pick-up time, deadhead time, check-in, and check-out time. This increases auditability and reduces “hidden time.”
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Security-search check-in and security pay</h3>
      <p>
        The agreement introduces a longer check-in for flights requiring security searches, and adds a security-pay provision.
        Structurally, this is a tradeoff: additional time obligations become explicit, but compensation is also engineered into the pay system.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Inflight rest facilities</h3>
      <p>
        The agreement adds concrete expectations about rest facility equipment and cleaning cadence, which supports fatigue management
        in long-haul rotation operations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="quality-of-life-and-reserve">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Quality of Life and Reserve Protections</h2>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Sick bank improvements (with documentation triggers)</h3>
      <p>
        The sick bank expands to ten days and introduces donation and conversion mechanics.
        However, the agreement also introduces earlier documentation/notice requirements for extended illness.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Hotels</h3>
      <p>
        The hotel article is significantly more enforceable because it moves from general “clean/safe/quiet” expectations
        into explicit room standards (Wi‑Fi, quiet placement, non-smoking, and more).
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subsection-title">Reserve: the biggest remaining gap</h3>
      <p>
        The agreement still does not fully engineer reserve as a complete subsystem. It continues to defer bidding and reserve language
        to future “meet and negotiate” work, and it explicitly treats reserve as an example of non-duty that receives no pay/credit.
        This is the clearest remaining high-risk zone in quality-of-life architecture, especially for a carrier where availability constructs
        can become the operational pressure valve during disruption.
