      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        Endeavor’s 2020–2025 Flight Attendant Agreement is a large, systems-oriented regional-carrier contract
        negotiated under the Railway Labor Act. The agreement is structured around formal scheduling logic
        (including PBS), detailed reserve architecture, and a comparatively mature enforcement system that
        integrates investigations, grievances, the System Board, and mediation into a single framework.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        Contract term and duration provisions are stated on the cover and in Section 20 (Duration).

    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Endeavor’s contract is built as a modular “systems contract” with high specificity and extensive procedural tracks.
        It places core enforcement (investigations/grievances/system board/mediation) early in the document and then
        builds scheduling and pay architecture through defined terms, enumerated triggers, and explicit timelines.
      </p>

      <p>
        The agreement contains both strong “rights language” and strong “process language.” Where the contract performs
        best is in areas where rights are supported by visibility, audit trails, and clear decision points. Where it performs
        less well is in complexity: interpretive load is high, and many protections require correct categorization of events
        and procedural compliance.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> High coverage and high reliability when used correctly, but not a “low-friction” contract for line-level users.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling architecture is one of the agreement’s strongest areas. The contract formalizes PBS bidding,
        minimum days off by bid month length, credit-time maximums, open time handling, time-available obligations,
        and rescheduling limits. It also contains explicit constraints on junior assignments and extensions, including
        annual decline entitlements and pay consequences.
      </p>

      <p>
        A standout structural feature is transparency: the Scheduling Committee is provided electronic access to scheduling
        transactions and audit trails, and reserve utilization transparency is reinforced through remote access to reserve
        information and reporting. These features materially strengthen enforceability by reducing information asymmetry.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Strong procedural constraints + strong visibility → higher enforceability than many peer regionals.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Endeavor’s economic architecture is robust for a regional carrier. Full-time monthly guarantee is seventy-five (75) hours,
        with substantial “above guarantee” pathways (open time pickup, will-fly, junior assignment, extensions, and certain credits).
        The agreement includes a trip guarantee framework, minimum day pay provisions, cancellation and reassignment pay,
        and defined escalation for very long duty periods.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contract’s pay system is not merely rate-based; it is structurally driven through defined credit construction
        (leg values/SATs, minimum day pay, duty-period boundaries, deadhead credit rules). This makes the agreement
        more predictable than “thin” wage-table contracts, but increases auditing complexity.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> Strong economic mechanics and guarantees, with higher verification burden due to size and procedural branching.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement is comparatively mature and front-loaded. The agreement establishes due process standards for investigations,
        explicit notice requirements, representation rights, and defined delivery methods for discipline. Grievance architecture
        includes structured timelines, System Board access, and explicit mediation procedures.
      </p>

      <p>
        The contract also includes expedited handling pathways for urgent disputes (including certain scope-related grievances),
        and it provides procedural safeguards that reduce “delay as a weapon.” While most remedies remain retrospective, the
        combination of visibility, timelines, and escalation pathways improves practical enforceability.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Strong process architecture that supports enforceability—especially compared to “paper rights” contracts without auditability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Strengths / Weaknesses / Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        Endeavor’s contract is a strong example of a modern regional “systems contract”: high specificity, defined constraints,
        and unusually strong transparency for scheduling and reserve utilization. Economically, it is structured around guarantees,
        minimum pay constructs, and predictable crediting logic rather than purely rate-based gains.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary structural weakness is complexity. The agreement’s protections often depend on correct procedural classification,
        timelines, and recordkeeping. This increases cognitive load for individual Flight Attendants and can shift enforcement into a
        “documentation contest” during irregular operations.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Comparative flag:</strong> Strong enforcement architecture for a regional carrier, with clarity/modularity constraints driven mainly by agreement length and procedural branching.

      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        Endeavor operates as a large Delta Connection regional carrier, which drives substantial schedule complexity and
        operational disruption frequency. This agreement’s strongest comparative contribution is its transparency and auditability
        in scheduling and reserve utilization, which materially strengthens enforceability relative to many peer regionals.
