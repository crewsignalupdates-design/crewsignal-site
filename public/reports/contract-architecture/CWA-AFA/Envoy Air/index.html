      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        Envoy’s 2021–2026 Flight Attendant Agreement is a large, systems-oriented agreement with extensive
        sideletter architecture and deep procedural specification across scheduling, reserve, and enforcement.
        The document explicitly frames itself as an amended, continuously updated agreement incorporating
        grievance settlements and side letters, which materially increases both coverage and interpretive load.

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Envoy is a “systems contract”: it uses defined terms, multi-step procedural tracks, and an extensive
        sideletter ecosystem to operationalize rules at scale. The table of contents shows 36 primary sections,
        followed by a long series of letters/sideletters and appendices, reflecting a contract that has evolved
        through negotiated amendments and dispute-resolution outcomes over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Architecturally, the agreement relies on: (1) formal bidding/scheduling logic (PBS + defined timelines),
        (2) detailed exception handling for disruptions and operational edge states, and (3) enforcement mechanisms
        that include grievance processing, System Board arbitration, and grievance mediation procedures.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> High coverage and strong “written remedies,” but a higher cognitive and documentation burden for line-level enforcement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling is built around a Preferential Bidding System (PBS), including pre-bid options, protest windows,
        lockout periods, and explicit line construction parameters. The agreement includes minimum days off
        provisions (including reserve “Golden Days”), duty/rest construction rules, and defined communication rules
        around rest-period contact and schedule changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key structural feature is the breadth of the assignment “ecosystem”: open time, automated and manual
        processing, trades/exchanges, drops, and defined “order of assignment” buckets. This architecture provides
        predictable rails for day-to-day operations but requires accurate classification and timely procedural action
        to preserve protections.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Strong scheduling protections exist, but they are highly procedural and therefore most effective when paired with auditability and enforceable timelines.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        PBS and scheduling architecture are detailed in Sections 8 and 9; duty/rest constructs are in Section 7. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The economic architecture is mechanically sophisticated for a regional carrier: the agreement provides
        a minimum monthly pay guarantee of seventy-five (75) hours for Flight Attendants available for duty for
        a full month, plus an “adjusted guarantee” framework tied to scheduled credit for lineholders, with
        additional pay mechanics for open time, deadheading, and certain disruption outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Premium pay and incentives are built into operational scenarios (e.g., junior manning/extension pay at
        enhanced rates, and “Critical Coverage” premiums for designated shortage days). These mechanisms
        matter in comparative analysis because they demonstrate where the contract shifts from “rules” to
        “economic deterrence” as a means of constraining management behavior.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        Minimum monthly guarantee and adjusted guarantee concepts appear in Section 4; premium structures are described in Scheduling/Reserve provisions. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement architecture is unusually mature for a regional agreement. The contract provides structured
        investigations (including representation rights and written outcomes), a defined grievance process with
        timelines, a System Board of Adjustment framework, and a formal grievance mediation program once a
        dispute reaches the System Board level (by mutual agreement).
      </p>

      <p>
        A notable structural advantage is that the enforcement system is explicitly designed to manage volume
        (quarterly case review meetings, scheduled mediation sessions, and document exchange requirements
        before hearings). This reduces delay risk relative to contracts that rely primarily on informal practice.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        Grievance, System Board, and mediation structures are described in Sections 21 and 22. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

    <!-- 6. Strengths / Weaknesses / Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        Envoy’s agreement exhibits a high level of institutional maturity: PBS-based scheduling, robust reserve
        constructs, defined “order of assignment” logic, explicit premium pay deterrence for staffing shortages,
        and an enforcement framework built to process disputes at scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary weakness is complexity. The agreement’s protections often depend on correct procedural
        classification and timely action (bid protests, notice windows, required calls, documentation thresholds).
        This raises the line-level burden and increases the risk that protections become “paper rights” when
        record access or process knowledge is uneven.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Comparative flag:</strong> Strong systems design and enforceability scaffolding, paired with a high interpretive load driven by length, sideletters, and procedural branching.

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="context-notes">
      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        Envoy operates as a large AAG regional carrier with high schedule complexity, multiple domiciles/co-domiciles,
        and heavy reliance on reserves and open time processes. This contract’s most meaningful comparative signal
        is its combined “systems design” + “enforcement scaffolding” profile, even as complexity reduces line-level
        accessibility.
