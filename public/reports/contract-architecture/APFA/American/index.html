    <!-- 1. Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        This agreement reflects a mature, legacy-carrier bargaining environment with extensive operational scale
        and a long lineage of negotiated amendments, interpretations, and side-letter architecture. As a baseline
        for CrewSignal’s contract architecture framework, it is best understood as a document designed to manage
        complexity at scale rather than a clean-sheet agreement optimized for simplicity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The APFA–American Airlines agreement is structurally dense and hierarchical. It relies on layered provisions,
        extensive cross-referencing, and exception language to balance standardized rules against irregular operations.
        This architecture supports enterprise-scale administration but increases interpretive load at the line level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Definitions function as control points throughout the agreement, while “notwithstanding” clauses and
        operational exceptions frequently narrow baseline protections. As a result, many rights exist in qualified
        form rather than as absolute guarantees.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> The agreement contains substantial protections on paper, but complexity and
        override pathways can reduce predictability and make outcomes more dependent on procedural precision.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling and assignment rules reflect a robust negotiated framework with clearly differentiated
        architectures for lineholders and reserves, defined reassignment concepts, and multiple pay-protection
        triggers. However, limits on company authority are often procedural rather than substantive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Operational exception language can soften baseline protections, and remedies are more commonly corrective
        than preventative. Crew obligations are frequently mandatory, while corresponding company obligations
        are conditional or context-dependent.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Protections exist, but they often rely on post-violation correction rather
        than pre-violation constraint.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The agreement demonstrates economic sophistication through layered pay-credit mechanics, rigs, and
        premium structures. It can generate strong earnings, particularly at scale, but reliability is sometimes
        contingent on procedural triggers and affirmative employee action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Complexity increases opacity at the line level, making verification and enforcement more burdensome for
        individual flight attendants despite the presence of multiple pay-protection concepts.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> Economic outcomes can be strong, but consistent realization often requires
        active navigation of the contract architecture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The enforcement system is formal and detailed, with defined grievance steps and access to arbitration.
        However, deterrence is structurally limited. Timelines exist, but consequences for delay are modest, and
        meaningful relief frequently arrives only after extended processing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Interim remedies are rare, and the burden of initiation, persistence, and proof often rests on the
        individual flight attendant. In practice, delay and ambiguity can advantage management.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural asymmetry:</strong> Enforcement inertia disproportionately affects employees, while
        management benefits from procedural delay.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Strengths / Weaknesses / Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        The APFA–American Airlines agreement reflects substantial institutional bargaining power and covers a wide
        range of subject matter. At the same time, exception density, complexity, and limited enforcement leverage
        weaken the practical force of many protections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to smaller or more modular agreements, this contract performs better economically than
        procedurally and relies heavily on post-violation remedies rather than self-executing constraints.

      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        This score reflects contract architecture and enforceability characteristics within a large,
        post-merger legacy carrier environment. It does not measure bargaining intent or effort, but rather
        the structural strength and reliability of negotiated protections as written.
