    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        This agreement reflects a mature, legacy-carrier bargaining environment with extensive operational scale
        and a long lineage of negotiated amendments, interpretations, and side-letter architecture. As a baseline
        for CrewSignal’s rubric, it is best understood as a contract built to manage complexity at scale rather
        than a “clean-sheet” agreement optimized for simplicity.
      </p>

      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li><strong>Carrier Profile:</strong> Large network carrier with significant domestic and international operations</li>
        <li><strong>Contract Lineage:</strong> Post-merger JCBA lineage, heavily amended over time</li>
        <li><strong>Document Ecosystem:</strong> Core agreement plus side letters / interpretations / carve-outs</li>
        <li><strong>Comparability Note:</strong> Scale and history increase density and exception load</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The APFA/American agreement is structurally dense and hierarchical. It uses layered provisions,
        cross-references, and exception language to balance standardized rules against irregular operations.
        This architecture supports enterprise-scale administration but increases interpretive load at the line level.
      </p>

      <h3>Architectural Traits</h3>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li><strong>High cross-reference density:</strong> outcomes often depend on interacting provisions across sections</li>
        <li><strong>Override hierarchy:</strong> “notwithstanding” and exception clauses can narrow baseline protections</li>
        <li><strong>Definitions as control points:</strong> defined terms strongly shape operational interpretation</li>
        <li><strong>Exception-driven construction:</strong> protections exist, but are frequently qualified rather than absolute</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> The agreement contains many protections “on paper,” but complexity and override
        pathways can reduce predictability and make enforcement more dependent on procedural precision.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling and assignment rules reflect a robust negotiated framework with clearly differentiated
        architectures for lineholders and reserves, plus defined reassignment concepts and pay-protection triggers.
        However, constraints often operate more as procedural requirements than substantive limits on discretion.
      </p>

      <h3>Structural Strengths</h3>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li>Distinct lineholder vs reserve architectures</li>
        <li>Defined reassignment concepts and procedural guardrails</li>
        <li>Multiple pay-protection triggers associated with disruptions</li>
        <li>Explicit duty and rest constructs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Structural Weaknesses</h3>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li>Operational exception language can soften baseline protections</li>
        <li>Company authority is frequently framed broadly, bounded by process rather than tight substantive limits</li>
        <li>Remedies tend to be after-the-fact rather than preventative</li>
        <li>Some obligations are mandatory for crew while company obligations are conditional</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Rubric lens:</strong> protections exist, but frequently depend on post-violation correction rather than
        pre-violation constraint.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The agreement demonstrates economic sophistication through layered pay-credit mechanics, rigs, and
        premium structures. It can produce strong earnings, but reliability is sometimes conditional on procedural
        triggers and employee action, increasing opacity and verification burden.
      </p>

      <h3>Positive Design Elements</h3>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li>Multiple rigs and credit mechanisms supporting predictable pay construction</li>
        <li>Premium architecture layered on top of baseline pay</li>
        <li>Pay protection concepts tied to schedule disruption and reassignment</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Limiting Factors</h3>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li>Pay outcomes can be contingent on compliance, availability, or specific procedural triggers</li>
        <li>Complexity increases opacity for line-level verification</li>
        <li>Some protections are not fully automatic and may require affirmative action</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> This contract can generate strong economic outcomes, but it often requires active
        navigation of the architecture to realize those outcomes consistently.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        The enforcement system is formal and detailed but structurally limited in deterrence. Timelines exist,
        yet consequences for delay are often modest, and remedies frequently arrive only after extended processing.
        This creates an asymmetry where ambiguity and delay can advantage management in practice.
      </p>

      <h3>Observed Characteristics</h3>
      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li>Formal grievance process with defined steps</li>
        <li>Timelines present, but default consequences for missed timelines are limited</li>
        <li>Arbitration access exists, but relief can be slow</li>
        <li>Interim remedies are rare or nonexistent</li>
        <li>Burden frequently rests on the individual flight attendant</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural asymmetry:</strong> management can benefit from delay and interpretive ambiguity,
        while flight attendants bear the cost of enforcement inertia.
