    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Scope &amp; Method</h2>
    <p>
      This review applies the CrewSignal Contract Analysis Criteria to the flight attendant collective bargaining agreement
      between Alaska Airlines and the Association of Flight Attendants (CWA–AFA).
    </p>
    <p>
      The analysis evaluates the contract as written, focusing on structural clarity, enforceability, and operational reliability.
      It does not assess bargaining intent, negotiation strategy, or legal outcomes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">I. Structural Clarity</h2>
    <p>
      The Alaska Airlines agreement is highly structured and modular, with clear segmentation between legality constraints, scheduling processes,
      and compensation outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Operational disruptions are categorized into distinct procedural tracks rather than handled through a single generalized rule set, improving
      internal logic while increasing navigational demands.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Structurally rigorous, but cognitively demanding.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">II. Rule Construction &amp; Precision</h2>
    <p>
      The agreement relies heavily on defined terms, enumerated triggers, and closed conditional logic. Outcomes are frequently specified in advance,
      limiting reliance on implied practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precision is achieved through formalization and cross-referencing rather than interpretive flexibility.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> High precision with limited tolerance for informal interpretation.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">III. Burden Allocation</h2>
    <p>
      Protections are generally available but are often conditioned on procedural compliance, including correct notice, method of contact, and acknowledgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agreement clearly allocates responsibility, but preservation of rights frequently depends on navigating defined processes correctly.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Balanced, but more process-dependent than peer agreements.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">IV. Enforcement Pathway</h2>
    <p>
      Enforcement mechanisms are explicit, with defined pay protections, valuation comparisons, and default outcomes when procedural steps fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remedies are generally reliable once the governing procedural category is correctly identified.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Strong remedies contingent on accurate procedural framing.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">V. Internal Consistency</h2>
    <p>
      Defined concepts such as contactability, reassignment limits, and pay valuation are applied consistently across sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross-referencing is extensive but deliberate, reflecting a contract designed to function as an integrated system rather than a collection of standalone rules.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Strong internal coherence with high interdependence.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">VI. Operational Reality Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      The agreement reflects the operational realities of a medium-to-large network carrier with variable flying patterns and frequent irregular operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formalization of contact methods and timing windows prioritizes predictability over flexibility in atypical scenarios.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Highly aligned with operational complexity.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">VII. Transparency &amp; Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      The contract presents a steep learning curve, requiring familiarity with defined terms and procedural categorization before protections become intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accessibility improves with experience, but first-pass usability is limited.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Below-average accessibility; above-average structural discipline.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Structural Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>Key strengths:</strong><br />
      Explicit defaults, disciplined definitions, bounded discretion, reduced reliance on practice
    </p>
    <p><strong>Structural weaknesses:</strong><br />
      High complexity, process-dependent protections, limited flexibility outside defined pathways
    </p>
    <p><strong>High-risk zones:</strong><br />
      Misclassification of disruption type; failure to satisfy formal notice or contact mechanics
    </p>
    <p>
      This agreement provides a useful counterpoint to more principle-based architectures and illustrates how explicit structure can substitute for operational practice.
