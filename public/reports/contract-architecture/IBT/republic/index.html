    <!-- 1. Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        Republic’s Flight Attendant agreement is a mature, system-administered regional-carrier CBA with detailed scope,
        scheduling, and pay subsystems designed to be applied through bid/assignment software and governed through explicit
        procedural rules. The agreement contains comparatively developed scope and successorship protections for a regional,
        including anti–alter ego concepts and structured handling of successor transactions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        Architecturally, the agreement is “system-forward”: it uses definitions, software-driven processes, and bounded
        procedural pathways to manage a complex operational environment at scale. Rather than relying on broad standards,
        it builds multiple rule families (scheduling, reserve, crediting, premiums) into administrable modules, with
        outcomes frequently determined by eligibility, timing, and procedural thresholds.
      </p>

      <p>
        The agreement’s architecture supports predictability and auditability when administered consistently, but can
        become discretion-sensitive in edge cases where “operational necessity,” buffer logic, reserve availability, or
        manual approvals shape outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> The contract is structurally reliable when the software + procedural rails are honored, but protections can weaken where discretionary approvals substitute for self-executing limits.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling is governed through an integrated bid and transaction ecosystem (line construction, reserve assignment,
        and open time processing), designed to route most schedule changes through standardized logic rather than ad hoc
        management action. The architecture emphasizes bounded transaction windows, legality buffers, and eligibility
        gating to control schedule modifications and reduce downstream conflicts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The agreement’s structure implies a high reliance on transparency mechanisms (posted open time, denial reasons,
        defined processing order) to make outcomes contestable. As with most system-driven contracts, the practical strength
        of this framework depends on whether “exceptions” are narrow and consistently recorded.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Scheduling protections are strongest where automation governs award order and denials are explainable, and weakest where manual discretion becomes the de facto control layer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        The pay architecture is layered and audit-oriented: compensation is driven by “greater of” constructs across
        scheduled versus actual values, with multiple credit drivers that can compete in a given month (e.g., leg-based
        block credit, trip/min-day style constructs, and premium overlays). Premium and override structures exist to price
        coverage problems and incentivize voluntary flying, but are frequently bounded by non-stacking logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        This design can generate strong economic outcomes in targeted scenarios (premium open time, overtime thresholds),
        but the interaction of credit drivers and non-pyramiding/non-stacking rules can reduce transparency and increase
        cognitive load for line-level verification.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> The pay system is capable and auditable, but credit layering and premium carve-outs can make “why I was paid X” harder to reconstruct in heavily modified months.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. Enforcement & Dispute Resolution Architecture -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution-architecture">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement follows the standard RLA pathway: staged grievance handling culminating in System Board adjudication.
        Structurally, the agreement’s enforcement power is shaped by whether time limits and step advancement meaningfully
        constrain delay, and whether remedies are framed as deterrent versus corrective.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where the agreement creates accelerated handling (notably in higher-stakes scope/successorship disputes), structural
        leverage increases. For routine scheduling and pay disputes, the architecture typically remains retrospective, with
        practical strength depending on persistence and documentation quality.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Enforcement is procedurally complete, but deterrence is uneven—strongest in expedited categories and weaker where remedies arrive only after delay.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="structural-strengths-weaknesses-and-comparative-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        Republic’s principal structural strength is modularity: it separates scheduling, reserve, pay/credit, and enforcement
        into distinct subsystems that can be administered through software and audited through procedural artifacts (postings,
        award logic, denial reasons). A comparative strength for a regional is the presence of developed scope and successorship
        architecture that can materially constrain circumvention if enforced.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary weakness is discretion sensitivity: buffer logic, operational necessity, and manual approvals can shift outcomes
        from substantive limits to procedural contests. Without consistent documentation and enforcement follow-through, the architecture’s
        complexity can dilute predictability rather than enhance it.
