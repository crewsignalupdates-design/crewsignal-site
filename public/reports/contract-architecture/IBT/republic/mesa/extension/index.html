    <!-- Agreement Metadata -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="agreement-metadata">
      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p>
        This extension and transition bundle consists of three coordinated instruments: the Mesa “CBA with Extension”
        (extension edition), the Mesa Tentative Agreement summary issued by AFA-CWA, and the IBT/AFA Joint Collective
        Bargaining Agreement (JCBA) Summary. Collectively, these documents function as integration instruments rather
        than as a standalone Mesa bargaining framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Republic Airways IBT agreement is explicitly identified as the base and controlling contract. Mesa Flight
        Attendants experience changes designed to align pay, scheduling processes, and quality-of-life provisions with
        Republic’s architecture pending full JCBA implementation. The amendable date for the combined framework remains
        October 12, 2027, with Railway Labor Act Section 6 negotiations scheduled to begin in 2027 if the JCBA is ratified.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Contract Architecture Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p>
        The architectural purpose of the extension is convergence rather than redesign. Mesa’s extension edition does
        not establish an independent rule system; instead, it selectively incorporates Republic contract structures to
        stabilize the combined operation during transition and to prepare for JCBA bargaining.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a structural perspective, Republic’s agreement remains intact and authoritative. Mesa-specific changes
        operate as transitional overlays, pointing Mesa Flight Attendants toward Republic norms rather than altering
        Republic’s underlying architecture.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> The extension functions as directional alignment, not as a renegotiation of the Republic contract.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Scheduling & Assignment Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-and-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p>
        Scheduling changes reflected in the extension materials focus on procedural harmonization. Mesa scheduling
        constructs, including Schedule Adjustment Period (SAP) concepts, trade windows, and reserve utilization
        transparency measures, are aligned toward Republic’s scheduling ecosystem rather than replacing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The JCBA Summary identifies adoption of Mesa SAP concepts within the Republic framework and establishes a joint
        reserve utilization subcommittee to address buffering, utilization, and transparency concerns during transition.
        These changes are framed as process alignment rather than expansions of scheduling discretion.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong> Scheduling convergence is achieved through procedural alignment, not through modification of Republic’s core scheduling controls.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Economic Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Economic changes described in the Mesa TA Summary are almost entirely Republic-derived. Mesa wage rates, per diem,
        and related economic provisions are matched to Republic’s scale, with transitional increases structured to
        preserve parity while the parties move toward JCBA negotiations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Supplemental economic provisions, where present, are time-limited and explicitly transitional. They function to
        prevent regression or disparity during integration rather than to establish independent Mesa economic norms.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> The extension achieves economic parity by importing Republic rates rather than by introducing new Mesa-specific economic architecture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Enforcement & Dispute Resolution Architecture -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-and-dispute-resolution-architecture">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p>
        Enforcement architecture remains anchored in Republic’s grievance and System Board framework. The extension
        materials do not restructure Republic’s enforcement pathways; instead, they provide Mesa-specific continuity
        protections to ensure accrued benefits are preserved during system conversion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Provisions addressing sick leave, vacation conversion, and PDO transition operate as protective overlays rather
        than as independent enforcement regimes. Disputes arising during transition are expected to be routed through
        the controlling Republic enforcement mechanisms.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong> Enforcement continuity favors Republic’s existing architecture, with Mesa provisions functioning as transitional safeguards.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Structural Strengths, Weaknesses & Comparative Flags -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="structural-strengths-weaknesses-and-comparative-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p>
        The principal structural strength of the extension bundle is clarity of direction. The Republic agreement is
        clearly identified as the base contract, and Mesa-side changes are framed as necessary adjustments to reach
        parity and facilitate integration. This reduces ambiguity about which rules control during transition.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary weakness is layered textual authority. Multiple documents must be read together to resolve specific
        questions, increasing cognitive load and the risk of “which instrument governs” disputes during the interim
        period, particularly in scheduling and crediting scenarios.

      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        This analysis evaluates the transition architecture rather than a finalized JCBA. Scores reflect how effectively
        the extension bundle preserves stability, parity, and enforceability during integration, not the long-term
        strength of the eventual joint agreement.
