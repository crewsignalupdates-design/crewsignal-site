    <!-- Overview -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        This report explains the joint representation framework governing Republic Airways and Mesa Airlines Flight
        Attendants during transition. It focuses on representation structure and governance mechanics under the
        Railway Labor Act (RLA), rather than on contract economics or work rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        The framework is notable because it preserves dual union representation—IBT at Republic and CWA-AFA at Mesa—
        while establishing a unified contract architecture anchored in the Republic agreement pending full JCBA
        implementation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Baseline Representation Structure -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="baseline-representation">
      <h2>Baseline Representation Structure</h2>

      <p>
        Prior to integration, Republic Airways Flight Attendants were represented by the International Brotherhood of
        Teamsters (IBT), while Mesa Airlines Flight Attendants were represented by CWA-AFA. Each carrier held its own
        certification under the RLA.
      </p>

      <p>
        The transition framework preserves these certifications rather than immediately consolidating representation
        through a representation election or majority absorption determination.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Majority Absorption vs. Joint Representation -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="majority-absorption">
      <h2>Majority Absorption vs. Joint Representation</h2>

      <p>
        Under the RLA, majority absorption is a doctrine through which one bargaining representative may be deemed to
        represent employees of an acquired carrier when operational integration and workforce dominance thresholds
        are met. Such determinations can trigger representation changes without a direct election.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case, the parties adopted a joint representation framework instead. This approach preserves existing
        certifications and avoids triggering an immediate representation election or absorption determination while
        transition and integration processes are underway.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Structural observation:</strong> Joint representation functions as a stabilization mechanism where parties elect to manage integration through negotiated governance rather than NMB intervention.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Role of the Transition / JCBA Framework -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="jcba-framework">
      <h2>Role of the Transition / JCBA Framework</h2>

      <p>
        The transition and JCBA framework establishes how authority is shared and sequenced during integration.
        Republic’s IBT agreement serves as the base contract architecture, while Mesa agreements and extension
        materials function as transitional overlays.
      </p>

      <p>
        This structure allows pay, scheduling, and enforcement systems to converge without extinguishing Mesa’s
        existing representation or triggering an immediate representation proceeding.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Implications for Contract Governance -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="governance-implications">
      <h2>Implications for Contract Governance</h2>

      <p>
        From a governance perspective, this framework clarifies that Republic’s contract controls the combined
        operation’s architecture, while Mesa documents operate as extension and transition instruments rather than
        as independent long-term agreements.
      </p>

      <p>
        This separation explains why Mesa materials are analyzed subordinate to Republic and why extension and
        transition documents are treated as governance artifacts rather than standalone contracts.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-note">
        <strong>Implication:</strong> Representation stability during transition is achieved through negotiated architecture rather than electoral or absorption-based reclassification.
      </p>

    <!-- Context Notes -->
    <section class="cs-report__section" id="context-notes">
      <h2>Context Notes</h2>

      <p>
        This report is descriptive rather than prescriptive. It distinguishes documented structure from inference
        and does not attribute strategic intent to any party beyond what is reflected in publicly available
        transition and JCBA materials.
