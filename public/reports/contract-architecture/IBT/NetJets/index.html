      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This analysis examines the collective bargaining agreement covering Flight Attendants employed by NetJets Aviation, Inc.
        and represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), Airline Division. The agreement governs a fractional
        ownership operation that differs fundamentally from scheduled Part 121 airline service in its duty patterns, tour structure,
        and relationship between work time, rest, and time away from home. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Unlike traditional airlines, NetJets operates under a tour-based model in which Flight Attendants are assigned multi-day
        rotations consisting of extended duty blocks followed by scheduled periods of time off. There is no conventional distinction
        between lineholders and reserves, no monthly bid package of individual pairings, and no daily reassignment paradigm comparable
        to hub-and-spoke carriers. As a result, scheduling concepts common to airline CBAs do not map directly onto this agreement.
        :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement operates under the Railway Labor Act and includes a comprehensive grievance and System Board of Adjustment framework.
        Because Flight Attendants live and work away from a fixed base for extended periods, the contract places heavy emphasis on tour integrity,
        rest sequencing, duty limits, hotel and travel standards, and recovery time rather than flight-by-flight assignment authority. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        NetJets’ Flight Attendant agreement represents a structurally distinct labor architecture within the CrewSignal framework.
        While negotiated under the same Railway Labor Act regime as airline CBAs, its internal logic is shaped by fractional flying:
        variable destinations, long duty days, non-linear trip construction, and extended periods away from home. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The contract is built around tour-based predictability, fatigue management through mandatory rest structure, and compensation aligned
        to duty exposure rather than block-hour productivity. Operational flexibility exists, but it is exercised within tour parameters rather than
        through airline-style daily reassignment. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Implication Summary:</strong> This agreement is best understood as a macro-level scheduling contract. Its strength lies in structuring
        work and recovery across extended tours, providing predictability and fatigue protection in an environment where daily scheduling discretion
        would be unworkable. Its limitations stem from the same design choice: flexibility is constrained by tour architecture, and remedies are
        largely corrective once work has already been performed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        NetJets’ scheduling and assignment framework is tour-based rather than pairing-based. The agreement governs work through predefined tours of duty,
        with protections designed to manage fatigue, predictability, and recovery over extended periods. There is no conventional airline reserve system;
        availability is embedded in the tour structure itself. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The tour is the primary control surface. Scheduling protections emphasize tour integrity, maximum duty and rest sequencing, and recovery between tours.
        Within tours, duty day composition may vary substantially, but tour-level limits and rest definitions provide the principal constraint mechanism. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Analytical Lens:</strong> This framework is constraint-forward at the tour level and flexibility-tolerant within tours.
        Protections are strongest in how work and rest are packaged and sequenced across days, not in flight-by-flight reassignment veto points.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        NetJets’ economic structure is aligned with its tour-based scheduling architecture rather than airline block-hour productivity.
        Compensation is designed to value time exposure and duty intensity, using overtime, extended day pay constructs, and additional pay programs that
        recognize long duty days and night duty realities common to fractional operations. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> This is a time-and-duty valuation system, not a flight-time productivity system. Pay logic reinforces scheduling logic
        by making extended duty and recovery consequences economically visible and auditable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Enforcement follows a complete Railway Labor Act model: a multi-step grievance process with defined timelines and information exchange, with escalation
        to a System Board of Adjustment including a neutral arbitrator. The agreement also includes mediation availability and designated expedited arbitration
        mechanisms to improve throughput in fact-intensive disputes. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Remedies remain corrective rather than punitive. In a tour-based system, many issues cannot be cured until after a tour is completed, so enforcement often
        focuses on post-tour correction rather than real-time intervention. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural Takeaway:</strong> Enforcement is procedurally complete but temporally delayed. The agreement’s practical strength depends on documentation and
        disciplined use of the grievance/SBA pipeline to preserve tour integrity and rest protections.

        <strong>Structural strengths:</strong> Tour-based predictability; explicit rest architecture; compensation aligned to duty exposure; robust scope and successorship protections
        with fencing/interest arbitration concepts; and a complete grievance/SBA system with throughput-aware features. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural weaknesses:</strong> High interpretive density and cognitive load; broad management rights constrained primarily through process; and corrective-only remedies

      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Comparative flags:</strong> This is a macro-architecture contract. Readers should evaluate it by tour integrity and rest sequencing rather than airline reserve paradigms.
