      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This analysis examines the collective bargaining agreement between Allegiant Air, LLC and the
        Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) covering Flight Attendants employed by the Company.
        The agreement became effective April 15, 2024, and runs through April 15, 2029 pursuant to the
        Railway Labor Act. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement represents a mature second-generation contract with detailed provisions governing
        scheduling, reserve utilization, reassignment authority, premium pay, and enforcement.
        It embeds explicit economic pricing of flexibility rather than relying primarily on grievance-based correction.

      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Allegiant’s TWU agreement reflects a constraint-and-pricing architecture. Operational flexibility
        is permitted, but it is consistently bounded, sequenced, and monetized through defined multipliers,
        footprint limits, and frequency caps. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Implication Summary:</strong> This contract disciplines behavior through cost and transparency
        rather than prohibition, reducing reliance on post-hoc enforcement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Scheduling is governed by PBS line construction with minimum days-off guarantees, followed by
        tightly controlled open-time, TDY, reschedule/reroute, Mission Mode, and junior assignment subsystems.
        Footprint logic and sequencing rules materially constrain ad hoc reassignment. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Compensation is tightly integrated with scheduling authority. Mission Mode pricing, escalating
        junior-assignment multipliers, footprint penalties, and comp-day cash-outs function as automatic,
        self-executing constraints on flexibility. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Formal grievance and System Board mechanisms remain corrective, but practical enforcement is
        front-loaded through economic self-execution and union access to operational data. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Allegiant’s agreement is a pricing-forward, data-aware contract that constrains repeat behavior
        through cost and visibility rather than categorical prohibition.
