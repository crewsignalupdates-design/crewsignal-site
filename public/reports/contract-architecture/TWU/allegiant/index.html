      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This analysis examines the collective bargaining agreement between Allegiant Air, LLC (the “Company”)
        and the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO (the “Union”) covering Flight Attendants in the service
        of Allegiant Air. The agreement is effective April 15, 2024 to April 15, 2029 under the Railway Labor Act,
        with renewal thereafter absent timely Section 6 notice. The Flight Attendant craft or class is referenced as
        certified by the National Mediation Board in Case No. R-7438 (February 26, 2016). 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This is a mature, comprehensive agreement with a high degree of operational specificity. It includes full
        scheduling and reserve subsystems (PBS line awards, Open Time mechanics, TDY rules, Reschedule/Reroute
        footprint constraints, and Junior Assignment sequencing), a dense premium architecture (Mission Mode,
        Premium Pay Open Time, BFH, escalation for repeated Junior Assignments), and formal enforcement through
        grievance and System Board procedures. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Architecturally, Allegiant’s agreement is notable for a ULCC because it does not merely preserve management
        flexibility and attempt to “make whole” later. Instead, it embeds self-executing pricing and sequencing mechanisms
        intended to shape operational behavior in real time, while providing the Union with meaningful visibility into
        the scheduling system and recurring operational data outputs. 
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Allegiant’s TWU agreement reflects a constraint-and-pricing architecture. Operational flexibility is preserved,
        but it is consistently bounded, sequenced, and monetized through defined multipliers, minimums, restoration
        mechanisms, and data visibility rather than being left to discretionary practice and later dispute resolution. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Several structural signals recur throughout the agreement. First, flexibility is made expensive through explicit
        premium systems (Mission Mode and Premium Pay Open Time multipliers, Junior Assignment escalation, and
        “footprint” penalties for Reschedule/Reroute actions outside defined boundaries). Second, scheduling authority
        is constrained by sequencing: Mission Mode attempts must precede Junior Assignment, and reserves must be
        projected to be used before certain same-day Junior Assignments occur. Third, enforceability is strengthened
        through system access and structured reporting to the Union, enabling pattern detection rather than isolated
        event disputes. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement also establishes meaningful structural protections around scope and transactional events. It includes
        successorship binding language and merger/acquisition provisions referencing McCaskill-Bond and Allegheny-Mohawk
        principles in seniority integration contexts. For a carrier of Allegiant’s size, these provisions are unusually explicit. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Implication Summary:</strong>
        This contract does not attempt to eliminate operational discretion. Instead, it disciplines discretion through
        (a) defined pathways, (b) hard boundaries (e.g., line construction and minimum days off), and (c) self-executing
        economic consequences that escalate with frequency and severity. It is structurally “mature” in the sense that many
        high-friction scenarios are pre-priced and sequenced rather than left to after-the-fact grievances.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Allegiant’s scheduling architecture is unusually explicit for a ULCC contract. It combines PBS-driven line construction
        with a dense post-award transaction system that governs Open Time, TDY, Trip Trades, Reschedule/Reroute authority,
        and Junior Assignment escalation. The throughline is consistent: flexibility is permitted, but it is bounded by defined
        windows, sequencing rules, and pricing mechanisms. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Line Construction and Minimum Days Off as Structural Boundaries</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement anchors predictability through minimum days-off guarantees and line construction limits. All bidders are
        guaranteed an annual average of twelve (12) Days Off per Bid Period; no line may be built with fewer than ten (10) Days Off
        in any Bid Period or with more than six (6) consecutive days of assignments. A minimum-days-off table governs partial
        availability scenarios (e.g., leaves, vacation), reducing ambiguity and discretion in prorations. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Open Time as a Controlled Market, Not Ad Hoc Assignment</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        After final awards and the protest process, Trips in Open Time are posted electronically and awarded first-come, first-served
        to Flight Attendants who are legal and available. Open Time is constrained by timing: it shall not be assigned before 1000 Pacific
        Time two (2) calendar days prior to Trip report. This reduces “informal reserve” behavior through premature assignment. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
      </p>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        A notable enforceability feature is the error-correction rule: if the Company places Trips into Open Time in error and fails to identify and
        correct the error within thirty (30) minutes after a Flight Attendant picks it up, the Flight Attendant is pay protected (PPSK). Mission Mode
        trips are not transactable in Open Time, preserving the integrity of premium coverage mechanisms. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">TDY as a Defined Subsystem</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Temporary Duty Assignments (TDY) are governed as a subsystem with explicit rules for seniority treatment, accommodations,
        transportation, luggage reimbursement, and early return. Involuntary TDY includes a minimum of one block of four (4) consecutive Days Off
        each Bid Period and defined economic protection when positioning occurs on a Day Off without a replacement Day Off (4.5 hours pay above guarantee).
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Trip Trading and Drops: Flexibility With Guardrails</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Trip trades are broadly permitted (including across Bases) subject to FARs and legal rest plus a one-hour buffer. Trades are unlimited
        if legalities are satisfied, and Flight Attendants may reduce schedules down to forty (40) credit hours through trades/giveaways and drops,
        with explicit rules governing reductions in applicable minimum guarantees when dropping below 75/80-hour thresholds. The agreement also includes
        bid-integrity guardrails that limit certain Company-driven duty changes immediately preceding bid openings. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Reschedule / Reroute Authority: Footprint Logic as a Constraint System</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The reschedule/reroute framework is a central constraint mechanism. The agreement distinguishes Reschedule (changes made ≥ 2.5 hours prior to show time)
        from Reroute (changes made &lt; 2.5 hours prior), and uses footprint rules tied to the original assignment to limit the scope of modifications. When duty is assigned
        outside the footprint beyond defined bounds, the Flight Attendant receives two (2) times their applicable rate for the entire pairing—an economically self-executing
        boundary enforcement tool rather than a purely compensatory provision. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Regular and Mixed line holders receive 250% of applicable rate for any additional flight segments added to their regular duty day (segments only; not Airport Standby or Reserve).
        These rules price incremental loading as a premium event rather than a routine adjustment. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Junior Assignment: Sequencing and Escalation</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Junior Assignment (JA) is constrained by sequencing and frequency pricing. A Mission Mode must be sent out prior to beginning the Junior Assignment process.
        Reserve usage is also prioritized: all legal Reserve Flight Attendants in Base must be projected to be used before a same-day Junior Assignment occurs.
        Repeated Junior Assignments are priced aggressively: if a Flight Attendant is Junior Assigned more than two (2) times in a Bid Period, subsequent JAs pay four (4) times
        the applicable rate, regardless of the underlying JA rate. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Reserve Architecture: Explicit Ordering and Guardrails</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Reserve is a structured subsystem with defined availability windows (continuous up to 12 hours unless assigned), report requirements (2 hours),
        contactability rules, call-out ordering logic (availability → legality → conflicts → hours flown/credited lookback with inverse seniority tiebreakers),
        and a defined Reserve call-out list data model. Golden Days (six immovable Days Off) are protected, with Comp Day remedies for certain conflicts. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Airport Standby is capped and structured: maximum five-hour period, first-in/first-out default assignment, a cap on involuntary Airport Standby call-outs (five per Bid Period),
        a 14-hour duty cap from Airport Standby report if a Trip is assigned, and stand-down limits (a Reserve can be called to the airport and not sent out no more than two times in a day;
        after the second stand-down, the Reserve is released). 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong>
        Allegiant’s TWU agreement is a procedural constraint contract with economically self-executing penalties. It allows the Company to operate flexibly, but forces
        that flexibility through sequencing (Mission Mode before JA), bounded authority (footprint rules), and escalating cost (including frequency-based escalation to 4×).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Allegiant’s economic architecture is deliberately interlocked with its scheduling and assignment framework. Compensation is not merely a valuation of flight time;
        it functions as the primary mechanism for disciplining operational flexibility. Where the Company exercises discretion, the agreement converts that discretion into escalating,
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Base Pay and Credit Foundations</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement provides a longevity-based pay table and defines compensation treatment for deadhead and training. Minimum duty pay is explicitly constructed using
        a “greater-of” logic (scheduled/flown, duty-based ratio, or fixed minimum), and minimum guarantees are set at 75 hours for most lines, with an 80-hour guarantee for
        certain reduced-days-off reserve lines. Payroll discrepancy resolution includes defined correction timelines, improving auditability in a premium-dense system. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Mission Mode as a Pricing Mechanism</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Mission Mode is a structural market mechanism that prices critical-period coverage at multipliers (e.g., 200%/250%/300%) with defined response windows and posting
        requirements. It can apply to Trips, Reserve periods, Airport Standby, and deadheads associated with Mission Mode assignments, and interacts with pay protection (PPSK)
        when removed under defined conditions. Mission Mode is also sequenced ahead of Junior Assignment, reinforcing the “price first, compel later” approach. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Junior Assignment Pay: Escalation by Frequency</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Junior Assignment pay is architected as a frequency-sensitive deterrent. JA pay references previously issued Mission Mode rates for the Trip and adds additional premium
        above guarantee. Repeated Junior Assignments beyond two in a Bid Period escalate to 4× pay for subsequent JAs, targeting chronic overuse rather than merely pricing the first event. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Reschedule / Reroute Premiums as Boundary Enforcement</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Footprint violations trigger premium outcomes. Assignments outside the defined footprint trigger 2× pay for the entire pairing, converting boundary violations into
        economically self-executing consequences that shape behavior without requiring grievance adjudication to be effective. Additional segment loading on Regular/Mixed lines
        is paid at 250% for added segments, reinforcing the cost of incremental loading. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Days Off, Comp Days, and Cash-Out Logic</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Days Off are treated as economically protected assets. Working into a Day Off after 0159 triggers Comp Day eligibility or an election for additional compensation,
        with defined option windows and protection rules for dropped and subsequently picked up trips. This dual system (restore time where possible, pay at a premium where not)
        reinforces the agreement’s overall logic: time has value, and losing it must be corrected or paid for at a rate that discourages casual use. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
        Allegiant’s TWU agreement uses economic architecture as enforcement. It makes non-standard operational actions (critical coverage, boundary-breaking reassignment, repeated involuntary
        utilization) expensive and visible, reducing reliance on time-delayed dispute resolution to discipline behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Allegiant’s enforcement framework is a conventional Railway Labor Act grievance and System Board model, with defined timelines and procedures for discipline and contractual disputes.
        Remedies remain corrective rather than punitive. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        What distinguishes this agreement is that practical enforcement load is shifted upstream into automatic economic consequences and sequencing requirements.
        Mission Mode must be attempted before Junior Assignment; footprint violations and repeated JA usage carry self-executing pricing; and many high-friction disputes are pre-priced rather
        than left to after-the-fact correction.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        A second enforceability layer is visibility. The agreement provides TWU Local 577 read-only access to the crew scheduling system and contemplates recurring data reporting
        on operational markers (reroutes, reschedules, junior assignments, Mission Mode assignments, premium pickups, fatigue calls, cancellations). This supports systemic oversight rather than
        grievance-by-grievance firefighting. 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong>
        Formal enforcement is complete but corrective. Practical enforcement is front-loaded through automatic pricing and transparency mechanisms that make overuse of flexibility
        increasingly expensive and observable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural strengths:</strong>
        Economically self-executing constraints; escalation by frequency (4× pay after repeated JAs); explicit reserve/standby architecture (Golden Days, stand-down limits, standby caps, call-out order);
        data access enabling systemic oversight; and robust scope/transaction framing (including McCaskill-Bond/Allegheny-Mohawk seniority integration principles and expedited arbitration in defined contexts).
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural weaknesses:</strong>
        High rule density and cognitive load; flexibility remains available if the Company is willing to pay (economic discipline rather than categorical prohibition);
        and corrective-only formal remedies (no punitive or deterrent sanctions beyond economic pricing embedded in work rules). 
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Comparative flags:</strong>
        This is a pricing-first enforcement model that relies less on post-hoc grievance correction and more on making non-standard operational actions expensive in real time.
        It is unusually explicit and modular for a ULCC, particularly in how it constrains repeat behavior.
