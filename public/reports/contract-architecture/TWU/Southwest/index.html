      <h2>Agreement Metadata</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        This analysis examines the collective bargaining agreement between Southwest Airlines Co. (the “Company”) and
        Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, Local 556 (the “Union”) covering Flight Attendants in the service of
        Southwest Airlines. The baseline agreement is a long-horizon instrument (2018–2028) with a mature operational rule
        stack: scheduling, additional flying, reserve assignment, legality (hours-of-service), and premium compensation are
        architected as interlocking subsystems rather than stand-alone topics.
      </p>

      <section class="cs-report__section" id="contract-architecture-overview">
      <h2>Contract Architecture Overview</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Southwest’s TWU agreement reflects a <strong>procedural constraint + priced flexibility</strong> architecture.
        Operational discretion is preserved, but it is disciplined through (a) defined sequencing rules, (b) time-gated windows,
        (c) explicit legality boundaries, and (d) self-executing premium outcomes. Rather than treating “schedule changes” as a
        monolith, the agreement creates multiple controlled pathways (voluntary coverage mechanisms, reserve assignment engines,
        and involuntary assignment tiers) that determine both authority and remedy.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        A core structural signal is that Southwest treats coverage as a <strong>market with rules</strong>, not merely a management assignment.
        Open flying is channeled through defined posting and award systems, reserves are assigned through specific ordering logic and
        availability definitions, and involuntary assignment (including junior assignment) is framed as a priced and bounded exception
        with defined notice/contact requirements.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Implication Summary:</strong>
        This contract does not eliminate operational discretion. It disciplines discretion through (a) sequencing (what must be exhausted first),
        (b) boundaries (legality, duty/rest, days-off protections), and (c) predictable economics (premiums, floors, and pay protections).
        As a result, high-friction disputes are more likely to center on <em>classification</em> (what category applied), <em>ordering</em> (what step had priority),
        and <em>auditability</em> (what the record shows), rather than purely subjective “reasonableness” arguments after the fact.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="scheduling-assignment-framework">
      <h2>Scheduling &amp; Assignment Framework</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Southwest’s scheduling architecture is anchored by three interacting subsystems: (1) a legality framework that defines hard outer limits on duty/rest
        and on-the-day operational continuity, (2) an “Additional Flying” system that functions as a controlled market for open trips and coverage,
        and (3) a reserve subsystem with defined availability, ordering, and assignment authority. The throughline is consistent: flexibility is permitted,
        but it is bounded by <em>clock</em>, <em>ordering</em>, and <em>price</em>.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Legality as a Hard Boundary System</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The Hours-of-Service and legality provisions function as the agreement’s “physics engine.” They constrain planned construction, reschedule authority,
        and the permissible shape of disruptions. This is architecturally significant because it turns many operational decisions into binary outcomes:
        legality is either satisfied or it is not, and that status controls the set of allowable next actions.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Additional Flying as a Governed Market</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Open trips and uncovered flying are not treated as ad hoc assignments. They move through structured posting and award mechanics
        (including defined timing windows and eligibility logic). This reduces informal “shadow reserve” practices and forces transparency in how coverage
        is offered, awarded, or ultimately assigned.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Reserve as an Assignment Engine, Not a Catch-All</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Reserve is architected as a system with specific ordering logic, contactability expectations, and assignment sequencing. This matters because it
        determines how quickly the operation can respond to disruptions and how predictable the reserve experience is for crewmembers.
        In heavily structured contracts, many disputes turn on whether the Company followed the proper reserve sequence before escalating to involuntary steps.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">VJA / JA as Coverage Pressure Valves</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Voluntary Junior Assignment (VJA) and Junior Assignment (JA) function as explicit “coverage valves.” VJA provides a priced voluntary mechanism during
        coverage stress; JA is the bounded involuntary backstop, typically governed by notice/contact rules, eligibility constraints, and compensation floors.
        Architecturally, this is a <strong>price-first, compel-last</strong> design: the agreement aims to clear coverage through voluntary economic incentives
        before authorizing compelled work.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Analytical lens:</strong>
        Southwest’s scheduling framework is best understood as “sequence + window + premium.” The contract repeatedly asks:
        (1) what category applies, (2) what step must occur before the next step, (3) what time window governs the action, and (4) what premium or protection
        applies if the schedule departs from the baseline.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="economic-structure">
      <h2>Economic Structure</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Southwest’s economic architecture is tightly interlocked with scheduling. Compensation is not merely a pay table; it is the agreement’s primary enforcement substrate.
        Premium outcomes, floors, and pay protections convert disruption, extension, and non-standard coverage into predictable economic consequences.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Pricing Deviation Rather Than Prohibiting It</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        When operations require non-standard outcomes—extended duty, reassignment, coverage events, or schedule disruption—the agreement generally allows the
        Company to act but makes the action <em>legible</em> and <em>priced</em>. This approach reduces reliance on delayed dispute resolution by baking a remedy into the event.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">RIG / Credit Floors as Value Protection</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Like many mature airline CBAs, Southwest uses credit-floor logic to protect value in thin flying and irregular operations. Where productivity assumptions vary,
        “greatest-of” style computations function as a stabilizer. A recurring architecture question (and frequent modification target in many contracts) is whether
        premium value can be “absorbed” by floor computations; the 2024 annotated package suggests attention to aligning premium intent with payable outcomes.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Premium Systems as Operational Governance</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__para">
        Premium pay and special coverage constructs do more than compensate crews; they steer behavior. Voluntary coverage premiums can reduce forced assignments,
        and involuntary premiums deter casual overuse. This makes economics a governance layer: the contract uses cost to shape operational decisions in real time.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
        Southwest’s agreement leans “baseline-first”: it anchors predictability to scheduled structures, then layers targeted premiums and protections for deviation.
        In practice, this creates a contract where compensation is the primary mechanism for translating operational disruption into standardized outcomes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="enforcement-dispute-resolution">
      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Dispute Resolution Architecture</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        The agreement provides conventional Railway Labor Act grievance and arbitration architecture. Remedies are primarily corrective, and the system is designed
        to resolve disputes about contract interpretation, application, and pay/credit outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        What distinguishes practical enforcement in this agreement is that many outcomes are <strong>self-executing</strong>. Because the contract embeds sequencing rules,
        time windows, and premium triggers, numerous disputes can be evaluated from records: what was posted, who was eligible, what was assigned, what notice was given,
        what category applied, and what pay construct should have triggered.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural takeaway:</strong>
        Formal enforcement is traditional; practical enforcement is front-loaded into system rules and premium triggers. The effectiveness of the contract in daily life
        therefore depends heavily on correct coding, correct classification, and correct sequencing in the operation.
      </p>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="strengths-weaknesses-flags">
      <h2>Structural Strengths, Weaknesses &amp; Comparative Flags</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural strengths:</strong>
        A mature sequencing model for coverage (voluntary mechanisms first, bounded involuntary backstops);
        explicit legality boundaries that constrain downstream discretion;
        and economic self-execution (premiums/floors/protections) that reduce reliance on after-the-fact dispute resolution.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Structural weaknesses:</strong>
        High rule density and cognitive load; reliance on correct system execution (posting/eligibility/notice/classification) to realize protections;
        and “procedural fragility” risk—when the operation misapplies categories or ordering, disputes become technical and labor-intensive to unwind.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__para">
        <strong>Comparative flags:</strong>
        Southwest’s TWU agreement is less “premium dense” than some ULCC pricing-first contracts, but it is highly structured.
        Its enforcement posture is driven by auditable sequencing and defined mechanisms rather than broad discretion with vague make-whole remedies.
