        This page preserves the unions’ joint tentative agreement summary reached following the
        Republic/Mesa merger. The agreement is explicitly structured as a mid-term JCBA,
        using the Republic contract as the base while protecting Mesa Flight Attendants
        during transition.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        The agreement preserves the parties’ path to full Railway Labor Act Section 6 negotiations
        beginning in January 2027, with an amendable date of October 12, 2027.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Comparative Timing Context</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        Notably, the Republic/Mesa tentative JCBA was reached approximately three weeks after
        the merger transaction closed. While post-merger bargaining timelines vary by carrier,
        scope, and legal posture, this compressed timeframe stands in contrast to prior
        industry JCBA processes.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        Following the 2011 United/Continental representation election, the combined Flight
        Attendant group operated for several years before a joint collective bargaining
        agreement was presented for ratification. CrewSignal highlights this contrast to
        illustrate how representation structure, inter-union coordination, and bargaining
        scope can materially affect post-merger timelines.

      <p class="cs-report__body">
        This comparison is offered as contextual analysis of process efficiency rather than
        as a judgment regarding substantive contract outcomes.
