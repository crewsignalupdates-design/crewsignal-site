      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Key Takeaways (2025)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          United Flight Attendants entered 2025 still in NMB mediation after filing
          for federal mediation in 2023, with no raises since 2020 and pay
          lagging key industry peers.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Tentative Agreement (TA) was reached in May 2025 that featured
          substantial first-year economic improvements, including higher base pay,
          retro pay, and boarding pay.
        </li>
        <li>
          On July 29, 2025, Flight Attendants rejected the TA by a wide margin,
          with very high turnout, sending the dispute back into mediation with a
          clear directive to address unresolved quality-of-life and work-rule
          issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Through the fall, AFA pivoted toward a “TA2” strategy that focuses on
          targeted fixes—particularly scheduling, reserve rules, hotels, and
          benefits—rather than a wholesale rewrite of the economic framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          By late 2025, AFA had presented a focused package of proposals to
          United management, with additional mediation/bargaining dates scheduled
          into late 2025 and early 2026.
        </li>
        <li>
          Through year-end 2025, negotiations remained active and structured
          under the Railway Labor Act, with no release from mediation and no
          strike deadline in play.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="background" class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Background &amp; Context</h2>
      <p>
        United Flight Attendants, represented by the Association of Flight
        Attendants-CWA (AFA), filed for federal mediation with the National
        Mediation Board (NMB) in 2023 after several years of stagnant pay and
        mounting frustration over scheduling, hotels, and quality-of-life issues.
        Under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), mediation is a formal but non-binding
        process—any agreement must still be voluntarily reached by the parties
        and ratified by the membership.
      </p>
      <p>
        By late 2024, the dispute was docketed at the NMB and a mediator assigned.
        Through 2024 and into early 2025, AFA relied on a mix of mediated
        sessions, direct bargaining, “from the table” updates, and system-wide
        mobilization to push toward an agreement that could gain majority support
        across a large and diverse Flight Attendant group.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
        Phase 1 – Mediation Builds Toward a Tentative Agreement (Jan–May 2025)
      </h2>
      <p>
        In early 2025, mediation and direct bargaining intensified. AFA’s public
        communications emphasized several core goals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Significant base pay increases designed to deliver industry-competitive,
          if not industry-leading, top-of-scale rates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Compensation for more of Flight Attendants’ on-duty time, including
          boarding and ground time that had historically gone unpaid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved scheduling rules, limits on excessive sit time, and stronger
          protections around redeye operations, crew rest, and reserve life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stronger contract language on hotels, improved benefits, and better
          long-term retirement security.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On May 23, 2025, AFA and United announced a Tentative Agreement covering
        roughly 28,000 United Flight Attendants. Public statements from both
        AFA and United characterized the deal as “industry-leading” on pay, with
        meaningful retroactive compensation and new boarding pay provisions.
        Aviation and business media framed the TA as aiming to bring United cabin
        crew broadly in line with major-industry peers on headline economics.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
        Phase 2 – Ratification Campaign and Member Concerns (May–July 2025)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Following the announcement of the TA, AFA launched an intensive
        ratification campaign, including roadshows, virtual meetings, FAQs and
        detailed summaries. These materials highlighted wage increases, boarding
        pay, the retro pay structure, scheduling provisions, hotel language, and
        proposed changes to benefits and retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Member feedback, however, revealed significant concern in several areas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Whether the TA adequately addressed long sit times and unpaid ground
          time between segments.
        </li>
        <li>
          The treatment of redeye flying, including the stacking of multiple
          redeyes and the impact on rest and safety.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reserve life, including Reserve Availability Periods (RAPs), scheduling
          predictability, and the ability to pick up additional flying on days
          off.
        </li>
        <li>
          Benefit thresholds, such as the 480-hour requirement for
          employer-subsidized health care, and whether these rules were
          appropriately updated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whether the economic framework fully reflected years of inflation and
          the extended time spent under an amendable agreement.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Voting on the TA ran through July and was supported by substantial
        communications from both the union and the company, as well as
        significant discussion and analysis from industry observers.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
        Phase 3 – TA Rejected, Mediation Re-Centers the Dispute (Late July–August 2025)
      </h2>
      <p>
        On July 29, 2025, United Flight Attendants voted to reject the Tentative
        Agreement. Turnout was exceptionally high, and a strong majority voted
        “No,” sending a clear message to the Master Executive Council (MEC) and
        negotiating committee.
      </p>
      <p>
        AFA framed the result as democracy in action and emphasized that, while
        the TA delivered meaningful economic gains, members were unconvinced that
        the package fully met their expectations for pay, scheduling, and
        quality-of-life improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
        By early August, the United MEC outlined a plan to return to the bargaining
        table with United management, supported by the NMB mediator. Rather than
        immediately seeking release from mediation, the union signaled its intent
        to continue working within the RLA framework to secure a revised agreement
        that could be ratified.

        Phase 4 – Reset with the Mediator and New Dates (September–October 2025)
      </h2>
      <p>
        In September, AFA and United met with the federal mediator to plan
        next steps after the TA’s rejection. Subsequent union updates reported
        that new mediation and bargaining dates had been secured and adjusted
        as the parties sought to maintain momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this period, AFA and outside commentators continued to stress
        that United Flight Attendants remained behind important comparators on
        total compensation and that members expected an agreement that combined
        pay, boarding pay, and improved work rules.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
        Phase 5 – Targeted Proposals for a Revised TA (TA2) (Oct–Nov 2025)
      </h2>
      <p>
        In late October 2025, AFA’s negotiating committee met with United
        management to begin structured work on a revised Tentative Agreement
        (“TA2”). Union updates described this phase as the start of a targeted,
        problem-solving effort aimed at fixing the issues that drove the “No”
        vote while preserving core economic gains from the original TA.
      </p>
      <p>
        AFA described a focused package of proposals that included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scheduling improvements</strong> – sit-time concepts, stronger
          protections around redeye flying, and improved notification and
          duty-life provisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reserve issues</strong> – refinement of Reserve Availability
          Periods (RAPs), how they can be used by the company, and additional
          flexibility for reserves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hotels and lodging</strong> – more explicit contract language
          around hotel standards and compliance expectations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Benefits and retirement</strong> – concepts designed to reduce
          friction around benefit thresholds and improve long-term security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Economic issues</strong> – AFA indicated that additional economic
          proposals could be advanced in later sessions as talks matured.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By year-end, additional bargaining and/or mediation dates were scheduled
        into late 2025 and early 2026, providing an observable cadence for continued
        talks under NMB oversight.

        Status at Year-End 2025
      </h2>
      <p>
        By the close of 2025, the United / AFA dispute remained firmly within
        the Railway Labor Act mediation framework:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The first Tentative Agreement has been rejected, but its economic
          structure—base pay increases, boarding pay, and retro pay—remains a
          likely baseline for any TA2.
        </li>
        <li>
          No release from mediation has been requested or granted, and there is
          no strike deadline in effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          The parties have completed initial post-rejection bargaining focused on
          targeted issues, with additional sessions scheduled.
        </li>
        <li>
          AFA’s strategy is centered on improvements in scheduling, reserve life,
          hotels, benefits, and enforcement language while defending economic gains
          already achieved in TA1.
        </li>
        <li>
          Management resistance to expanding total economic cost remains a key
          constraint shaping the likely TA2 pathway.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Outlook &amp; Framework for Weekly Updates
      </h2>
      <p>
        This 2025 review establishes the baseline for Crew Signal’s ongoing
        coverage of United / AFA mediation. Weekly updates will track:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Session activity:</strong> what was scheduled and what occurred.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proposal movement:</strong> shifts on scheduling, reserve, hotels,
          benefits, and economics compared with prior baselines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Signals from AFA and United:</strong> public statements and
          communications that indicate hardening or softening of positions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Escalation vs. de-escalation:</strong> steps toward public actions,
          requests for release, or signs of convergence on a TA2 framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comparative context:</strong> other negotiations influencing pattern
          expectations for United Flight Attendants.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The core question entering 2026 is whether targeted adjustments within an
        existing economic framework can produce a TA2 that members will ratify, or
        whether the dispute will deepen into more intensive mediation and potential
        discussion of release.
