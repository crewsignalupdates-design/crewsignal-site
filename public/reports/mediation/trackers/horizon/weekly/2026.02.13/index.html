        <p class="cs-report__body">
          No public indication of a release from National Mediation Board (NMB) mediation, and no announced
          cooling-off timeline. The primary public development this week was a combined CWA-AFA negotiating
          committee update covering late January and early February bargaining activity, including a three-day
          early-February session and a detailed summary of progress and sticking points.

        <ul class="cs-report__list">
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Sessions recap (late Jan + early Feb):</strong> The committee reported a January session in
            Chicago (Jan 21–23) and an early-February session (Feb 2–4), with the mediator joining virtually on
            Feb 4 after two days conducted without in-person mediator participation.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Contract language progress:</strong> The committee reported meaningful movement in scheduling
            language (Article 6), including bid/return-to-duty mechanics and standardized internal bidding deadlines.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Economics costing underway:</strong> The parties’ economists began costing economic proposals,
            with the process expected to conclude in the near term—an indicator negotiations are moving into a
            “full-package” pressure phase where multiple items are treated as economic.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Deadlock on specific non-economic protections:</strong> The committee described a February
            deadlock on certain protections (including workers’ compensation appointment-related protections),
            emphasizing the difference between enforceable contract language and unilateral company policy.
          </li>
          <li class="cs-report__list-item">
            <strong>Management commitment flagged:</strong> The committee reported that management committed to
            present a “meaningful” comprehensive proposal at the start of the next session, including a new pay proposal.
          </li>

        <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">CrewSignal Assessment</h2>
        <p class="cs-report__body">
          This week’s signal is less about visible “NMB action” and more about the underlying bargaining phase
          shift: economics costing is active, and both sides are positioning for a comprehensive management package
          at the next session. That combination typically increases the value of member engagement and also clarifies
          whether talks are moving toward a workable framework—or toward extended mediation with slower movement.

            Whether economics costing concludes and becomes a shared baseline for closing issues.
