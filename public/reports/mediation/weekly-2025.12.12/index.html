    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available information,
    including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant mediation agencies,
    as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be
    interpreted as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal talks, tentative
    agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when evaluating labor dispute developments.

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    United Airlines and AFA-CWA returned to mediated bargaining under the National Mediation Board during the
    week ending 2025.12.12, with multiple days of sessions completed (December 9–12). No new tentative agreement
    was announced, and there was no NMB release into a 30-day cooling-off period — indicating continued facilitated
    negotiations rather than escalation.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Additional mediated sessions were scheduled for January 6–9. In RLA-governed bargaining, that scheduling signal
    is meaningful: it suggests the NMB continues to see a productive path in continued talks, even as key economic and
    quality-of-life sections remain unresolved and public disclosure remains limited by confidentiality norms.
  </p>

  <div class="cs-report__callout">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Negotiation watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Session cadence:</strong> Whether January sessions expand in scope or frequency (a leading indicator of urgency and sequencing).</li>
      <li><strong>Posture shift language:</strong> Any change in union/company messaging from “productive” framing toward impasse or release requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Cooling-off signals:</strong> Any indication the NMB is considering (or declining) release as leverage and timelines evolve.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>United–AFA mediation status:</strong> United and AFA met in mediated negotiations from December 9 through December 12 under NMB supervision.
    As of week’s close, neither party announced a new tentative agreement and the NMB did not release the parties into a cooling-off period.
    Public communications confirm unresolved contract sections remain in play, but neither side has publicly disclosed detailed package terms.
    Additional sessions scheduled for January 6–9 signal continued engagement.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Broader airline mediation landscape:</strong> Other publicly confirmed airline-industry cases remained in active mediation with limited public
    movement signals during this reporting window. Public themes across those disputes continue to cluster around compensation alignment,
    scheduling stability, retention, and fatigue-related work-rule structures.
  </p>

  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li><strong>Allegiant — ALPA (Pilots):</strong> Active mediation; public themes include scheduling stability, duty-day structure, and compensation alignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Hawaiian — ALPA (Pilots):</strong> NMB mediation continues with economic items still open; no release or TA reported this week.</li>
    <li><strong>Mesa — ALPA (Pilots):</strong> Mediated negotiations continue with retention, compensation structure, and operational stability concerns cited publicly.</li>
    <li><strong>PSA Airlines — ALPA (Pilots):</strong> Active mediation; public updates continue to reference staffing and fatigue-related work-rule categories.</li>
    <li><strong>Envoy Air — IAM (Fleet &amp; Ground):</strong> NMB-mediated negotiations remain open; economics and workplace standards unresolved in public framing.</li>
    <li><strong>Other open dockets:</strong> Piedmont / ALPA (Pilots) quiet publicly; Alaska / ALPA involves limited NMB engagement on implementation matters.</li>
  </ul>
