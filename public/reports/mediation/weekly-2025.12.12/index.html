    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation Update is based solely on publicly available information,
    including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant
    mediation agencies, as of the report date. It is prepared for informational
    purposes for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted
    as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal
    talks, tentative agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when
    evaluating labor dispute developments.

  <!-- Section 1: United–AFA Mediation Status -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">1. United–AFA Mediation Status</h2>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      United Airlines and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) met in mediated
      negotiations from December 9 through December 12 under the supervision of the
      National Mediation Board (NMB). The sessions marked a continuation of active
      bargaining following earlier tentative agreement discussions earlier in 2025.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      As of the close of the week, neither party announced a new tentative agreement,
      and the NMB did not release the parties into a 30-day cooling-off period. Mediation
      therefore remains ongoing under the Railway Labor Act.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Public communications from the union confirm that bargaining continues on
      unresolved contract sections. Consistent with RLA confidentiality rules, no
      detailed proposal language or package terms have been publicly disclosed by
      either party.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Additional mediated sessions have been scheduled for January 6–9, indicating that
      the NMB continues to view the dispute as suitable for further facilitated
      negotiations rather than escalation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">2. Other Active Airline-Industry Mediation Cases</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      <em>
        All cases below are publicly confirmed through union communications and National

    <h3 class="cs-report__subheading">Allegiant — ALPA (Pilots)</h3>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Mediation remains active, with ALPA continuing to identify scheduling stability,
      duty-day structure, and compensation alignment as broad categories in dispute.
    </p>

    <h3 class="cs-report__subheading">Hawaiian — ALPA (Pilots)</h3>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Hawaiian pilots remain in NMB-supervised mediation with economic items still open.

    </p>

    <h3 class="cs-report__subheading">Mesa — ALPA (Pilots)</h3>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Mesa Airlines continues in mediated negotiations addressing pilot retention,
      compensation structure, and operational stability concerns.
    </p>

    <h3 class="cs-report__subheading">PSA Airlines — ALPA (Pilots)</h3>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Mediation remains active, with union updates continuing to reference staffing and
      fatigue-related work-rule categories.

    <h3 class="cs-report__subheading">Envoy Air — IAM (Fleet &amp; Ground)</h3>
    <p class="cs-report__body">

  <!-- Section 3: Outlook -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">3. Late-December / Early-January Outlook</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      United–AFA remains the most closely watched flight-attendant mediation currently
      before the NMB. The scheduling of additional January sessions suggests continued
      engagement rather than impasse, though no clear timeline for a tentative
      agreement has been established.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Across the broader airline sector, mediation activity remains steady but subdued,
      with few public signals of imminent releases or cooling-off periods as the year
      draws to a close.
