    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available information,
    including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant mediation agencies,
    as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be
    interpreted as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or as a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal talks, tentative
    agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when evaluating labor dispute developments.

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    No publicly released updates were issued during the week ending 2025.11.21 by AFA-CWA,
    United Airlines, or the National Mediation Board regarding the resumed contract negotiations
    that began earlier in November. This reporting window therefore represents a continuity
    week rather than a public inflection point.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    In mediation-driven negotiations, periods without public movement are common and often
    reflect private caucusing, internal alignment, or procedural sequencing rather than stalled
    talks. CrewSignal continues weekly tracking to preserve a clean timeline as future bargaining
    or mediation steps emerge.

    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Negotiation watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Mediation posture:</strong> Whether formal mediation sessions are announced or confirmed publicly.</li>
      <li><strong>Proposal movement:</strong> Any counter-proposal or revised package following the earlier rejected TA.</li>
      <li><strong>NMB involvement:</strong> Signs of docket activity or facilitated bargaining engagement.</li>

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    No mediation sessions were announced or confirmed publicly during this reporting period.
    There was no visible National Mediation Board docket activity related to United–AFA,
    and neither party released updated bargaining proposals beyond the union’s early-November
    priorities list.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Industry labor coverage was active during the week, but none of the reported disputes
    or bargaining developments involved United Airlines or AFA-CWA. Previously published
    union demands — including hotel standards, sit-rig pay, red-eye limits, reserve policy
    changes, and long-haul rest — therefore remain the operative reference points.
