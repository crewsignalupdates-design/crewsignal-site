    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation Update is based solely on publicly available information,
    including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant
    mediation agencies, as of the report date. It is prepared for informational
    purposes for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted
    as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal
    talks, tentative agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when
    evaluating labor dispute developments.

          <p>
            <strong>No publicly released updates</strong> were issued this week by AFA-CWA, 
            United Airlines, or the National Mediation Board regarding the resumed contract 
            talks that began earlier in November.

            <li><strong>No mediation sessions announced</strong> or confirmed publicly.</li>
            <li><strong>No NMB docket activity</strong> related to United–AFA this week.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>No updated bargaining proposals</strong> published by either party beyond

              Industry labor coverage was active this week, but <strong>none involved United or AFA</strong>.

            <li>
              The union’s earlier published demands (hotel standards, sit-rig pay, red-eye limits, 
              reserve policy changes, long-haul rest) remain the reference points as no revisions were issued.
