    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available regulatory,
    company, and union-source information as of the report date. It is prepared for
    crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as legal advice,
    bargaining guidance, or as a prediction of any specific negotiation outcome.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between informal talks, mediated processes,
    arbitration tracks, and contract ratification pathways when evaluating labor
    dispute-resolution signals.

<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The week ending 2025.12.26 reflects a holiday-window continuity posture across the airline labor landscape:
    fewer publicly visible updates, fewer procedural markers, and limited public messaging even where active
    mediation and bargaining tracks remain open. This is typical of late-December cycles and should be read as
    a visibility change, not a conclusion about underlying movement.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    In mediated negotiations, the most useful “quiet-week” indicators are process signals rather than outcomes:
    whether additional session dates are scheduled, whether either side shifts posture language, and whether
    public campaigns accelerate (a common proxy for leverage-building when confidentiality limits details).
    CrewSignal continues weekly tracking to preserve a clean record as calendars reset into early 2026.

  <div class="cs-report__callout">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Negotiation watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Session cadence:</strong> New dates (or cancellations) that signal either renewed engagement or stalled scheduling as parties enter January.</li>
      <li><strong>Posture language:</strong> Movement from “ongoing/constructive” messaging toward deadlines, impasse framing, or release-request signaling.</li>
      <li><strong>Escalation indicators:</strong> Picketing cadence, strike-authorization framing, or “status quo strain” that increases operational risk without changing legal posture.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    No new high-visibility public releases, cooling-off announcements, or ratified tentative agreements were observed
    during this reporting window. Existing mediation and bargaining tracks appear to remain in positioning phases,
    with limited external markers typical of the late-year calendar.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The practical takeaway for crews is that holiday-week silence can coincide with real internal work: committee alignment,
    package refinement, and session scheduling often occur without public disclosure. The next meaningful visibility shift
    typically arrives with new session dates, a change in public tone, or a clear procedural step (e.g., intensified mediation
    involvement or a public campaign escalation).

    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Primary signal set:</strong> Continuity week; no new publicly visible endgame steps (release/cooling-off) or ratified outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Process posture:</strong> Expect limited external visibility during late-December; watch for January scheduling signals to reappear first.</li>
      <li><strong>System-wide:</strong> Leverage often shifts before milestones appear publicly — especially when operational strain or staffing pressure rises.</li>

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What We’re Watching Next</h2>

  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li>Early-January session scheduling signals across active airline mediation tracks (new dates, expanded cadence, or notable cancellations).</li>
    <li>Any public posture change toward deadlines, impasse language, or release-request framing as committees and carriers reset strategy.</li>
    <li>Escalation indicators that raise pressure without changing legal posture (picketing cadence, strike-authorization messaging, social media campaign ramps).</li>
    <li>Operational stress signals (reliability strain, staffing fatigue, reserve pressure) that can tighten timelines and change leverage dynamics.</li>
  </ul>
