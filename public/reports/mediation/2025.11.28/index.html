    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available information,
    including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant mediation agencies,
    as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be
    interpreted as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or as a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal talks, tentative
    agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when evaluating labor dispute developments.

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The week ending 2025.11.28 was relatively quiet for new high-visibility airline mediation dockets,
    with the public “signal set” defined more by the status of existing disputes than by new case openings.
    In continuity windows like this, the practical question is not “what filed” but “what is moving.”
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Allegiant’s pilot talks remain a useful reference point for how RLA-governed disputes can sit in a
    high-tension, low-movement posture: informational picketing can escalate public pressure while the
    parties remain constrained by status quo obligations absent an NMB release and cooling-off period.

    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Negotiation watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>NMB signal changes:</strong> Any new publicly visible airline-related mediation activity that indicates a posture shift or new docket opening.</li>
      <li><strong>Release / cooling-off dynamics:</strong> Whether high-profile disputes move toward an NMB release that starts the formal 30-day clock.</li>
      <li><strong>Pressure vs. process:</strong> Informational picketing, strike authorization votes, and public messaging that increase leverage without changing legal status.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>NMB activity (signal check):</strong> As of 2025.11.28, the National Mediation Board’s publicly posted weekly activity
    ran through the week ending 2025.11.21, with no new high-profile airline carrier mediation dockets visible in that window.
    The airline mediation landscape therefore remained defined by ongoing cases and bargaining phases rather than fresh filings.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Allegiant pilots (Teamsters):</strong> Allegiant pilots conducted informational picketing at 22 airports on 2025.11.18,
    highlighting stalled contract negotiations and long-running scheduling and pay concerns. From an RLA posture lens, this remains
    a constrained dispute: a strike authorization vote and a request for release can raise pressure, but absent an NMB release the parties
    remain bound to maintain the status quo.

    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>NMB signal set:</strong> Continuity week; no new high-visibility airline mediation dockets visible in the posted activity window.</li>
      <li><strong>Allegiant pilots:</strong> Pressure escalates via informational picketing; legal posture unchanged without NMB release/cooling-off.</li>
      <li><strong>System-wide:</strong> RLA timelines move slowly, but leverage can shift quickly through public pressure and operational risk.</li>

  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li>Any new publicly visible NMB mediation activity that signals airline-case posture changes or new docket openings.</li>
    <li>Movement toward (or away from) an <strong>NMB release</strong> in high-pressure disputes, triggering the 30-day cooling-off framework.</li>
    <li>Additional informational picketing, strike authorization messaging, or bargaining updates that materially shift leverage.</li>
    <li>Merger-adjacent integration programs encountering labor gating events (timelines, representation, or seniority conflicts) in the shadow of RLA constraints.</li>
