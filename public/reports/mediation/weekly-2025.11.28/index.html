      A relatively quiet week for new NMB airline filings, but Allegiant’s stalled talks and broader labor unrest

    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation Update is based solely on publicly available information,
    including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant
    mediation agencies, as of the report date. It is prepared for informational
    purposes for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted
    as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal
    talks, tentative agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when
    evaluating labor dispute developments.

  <!-- Section 1: NMB activity -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">1. NMB Activity · Airline Mediation Signal Check</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      As of November 28, 2025, the National Mediation Board’s publicly posted weekly activity runs through the
      week ending November 21, with no new high-profile airline carrier mediation dockets emerging in the days
      since. Much of the NMB’s visible work remains in freight rail and regional carriers, with airline labor
      disputes continuing mostly in ongoing mediation or bargaining phases rather than fresh filings.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Practically, that means the airline mediation landscape this week is defined more by the <em>status</em> of existing
      cases than by new docket openings. Carriers and unions remain in the familiar cycle of mediated talks,
      side-table work, and public messaging rather than structural changes in case posture.

  <!-- Section 2: Allegiant pilots – stalled talks under RLA -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">2. Allegiant Pilots: Stalled Talks &amp; RLA Constraints</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Allegiant pilots, represented by the Teamsters, conducted informational picketing at 22 airports on
      November 18, highlighting stalled contract negotiations and long-running scheduling and pay concerns.
      Pilots are still operating under a contract that became amendable in 2021, and while Allegiant has
      signaled significant wage increases and retention bonuses, the union describes the current proposals as
      inadequate on quality-of-life terms.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      From an RLA mediation perspective, Allegiant is an example of how long-running talks can sit in a
      “high-tension, low-movement” phase: the pilots have already voted to authorize a strike and requested a
      release from mediation, but the NMB has not yet taken the decisive step of releasing the parties into a
      30-day cooling-off period. Until that happens, the dispute remains constrained by the RLA’s requirement
      that both sides maintain the status quo.
    </p>

    <div class="cs-report__callout">
      <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Key RLA concepts in play</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>“Amendable” ≠ expired:</strong> Contracts remain in force until the RLA process is exhausted, even after becoming amendable.</li>
        <li><strong>Release &amp; cooling-off:</strong> Only an NMB release starts the formal 30-day clock toward self-help or presidential intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Informational picketing vs. strike:</strong> Picketing is protected speech and pressure, not a strike, and does not require a release.</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- Section 3: Mediation context for mergers & integration -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">3. Mediation as a Shadow Factor in Merger Integration</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      For merger and integration watchers, this week’s mediation backdrop matters less for new docket headlines
      and more for context. Integration programs — such as the newly closed Republic–Mesa transaction and the
      still-developing Alaska–Hawaiian combination — will be shaped by the same NMB timelines and RLA guardrails
      that are constraining Allegiant’s pilots today.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Where labor groups are already signaling frustration over pay, scheduling, or representation, the risk is
      not just a single contract dispute but a scenario where integration milestones collide with strike
      authorization votes, representation elections, or seniority integration fights. This week’s Allegiant
      developments are therefore best read as a reminder that RLA-governed mediation is a slow-moving but
      powerful variable in any merger playbook.
