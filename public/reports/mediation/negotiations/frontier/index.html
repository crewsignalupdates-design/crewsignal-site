      <h2>📌 Section 6 Negotiations — Amendable Contract</h2>
      <p>
        Public CWA-AFA communications indicate that Frontier’s flight attendant agreement became amendable in 2024 and that the union
        has invoked the National Mediation Board (NMB) process as part of Section 6 bargaining under the Railway Labor Act (RLA).
      </p>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA has publicly reported filing for federal mediation in 2024 and has continued to publish negotiation dates and member
        update calls, indicating ongoing bargaining activity.

      <h2>🧭 Mediation &amp; Bargaining Posture (Publicly Reported)</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA publicly reported filing for federal mediation with the NMB in May 2024 relating to bargaining over the impacts of
        the company’s business model changes. CWA-AFA later reported filing for mediation in October 2024 as part of Section 6 bargaining,
        noting the case would be docketed and assigned a mediator by the NMB.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public CWA-AFA Frontier communications also list scheduled negotiation sessions and related membership update calls, including
        sessions in November and December 2025.
