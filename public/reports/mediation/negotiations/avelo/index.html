      <h2>📌 First Contract Negotiations — Ongoing</h2>
      <p>
        Avelo flight attendants are engaged in negotiations toward a first collective bargaining agreement.
        Public union updates indicate the parties have been bargaining in sections and reporting tentative agreements
        on selected sections as negotiations continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of this posting, CrewSignal has not identified a publicly posted tentative agreement for the full contract,
        a ratification vote schedule, or a complete bargaining calendar published by the parties.

      <h2>🗂️ Organizing &amp; Representation Milestones (Publicly Reported)</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__note">
        Because this is a first contract negotiation, certain organizing and representation milestones are publicly
        observable (NMB filings, election authorization, certification) even when bargaining details and timelines are not.
        The items below reflect procedural developments only and do not imply bargaining outcomes or forecasts.
      </p>

      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Representation application filed:</strong> AFA-CWA filed a representation application with the National Mediation Board (NMB)
          on <strong>October 12, 2021</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Election authorized:</strong> The NMB issued Findings Upon Investigation and authorized an election on
          <strong>February 15, 2022</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Certification issued:</strong> The NMB issued a certification on <strong>April 14, 2022</strong>,
          certifying AFA-CWA as the representative for Avelo flight attendants.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Note on organizing costs: CrewSignal has not identified a carrier-specific public disclosure that itemizes the costs of the Avelo organizing campaign
        (e.g., “money spent”) as a standalone figure.

      <h2>🧭 First Contract Bargaining Process (Context)</h2>
      <p>
        First contracts often take extended time because the parties must build an entire agreement from the ground up
        (recognition, scope, scheduling/work rules, compensation, benefits, grievance/arbitration, and union rights),
        rather than modifying an existing amendable agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public Avelo AFA updates describe bargaining in discrete “sections,” reaching tentative agreement on sections over time,
        and using member engagement tools (e.g., update meetings and a Contract Action Team) typical of first-contract campaigns.
