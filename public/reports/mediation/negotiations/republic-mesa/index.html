      <h2>📌 Interim JCBA — Mid-Term, Time-Limited</h2>
      <p>
        Following the Republic–Mesa transaction, an interim joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA) was reached
        under a shared representation framework involving two labor organizations:
        the <strong>International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT)</strong> and <strong>CWA-AFA</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public reporting indicates that this interim JCBA was reached approximately <strong>three weeks</strong> after
        the transaction closed — an unusually rapid timeline compared to typical post-merger integration bargaining.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="representation">
      <h2>🧾 Joint / Shared Representation</h2>
      <p>
        Republic flight attendants are represented by <strong>IBT Local 135</strong>, while Mesa flight attendants are
        represented by <strong>CWA-AFA</strong>. As a result, the interim JCBA required not only negotiations with the
        company, but also coordination and agreement between the two unions regarding structure, scope, and duration.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-report__note">
        This joint representation arrangement is distinct from standard single-union bargaining and from traditional
        JCBAs negotiated under a single representative organization.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="process">
      <h2>🧭 Negotiation Process </h2>
      <p>
        Public descriptions of the process indicate that the interim JCBA was designed to function as a
        <strong>bridge agreement</strong>, preserving stability while deferring full harmonization to a later
        Section 6 bargaining cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Republic collective bargaining agreement was used as the <strong>baseline template</strong> for the interim
        JCBA, allowing the parties to move quickly while avoiding prolonged disputes over foundational structure.
        Differences between the legacy agreements are addressed in detail in the Contract Architecture section.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to company bargaining, the process required union-to-union negotiation to determine how the interim
        agreement would be administered, how representation would function during the interim period, and how future
        bargaining rights would be preserved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="future-bargaining">
      <h2>⏳ Path to Full Section 6 Negotiations</h2>
      <p>
        The interim JCBA explicitly preserves the parties’ ability to engage in full Section 6 negotiations beginning
        in <strong>January 2027</strong>. The interim agreement is not intended to replace or foreclose a comprehensive
        successor agreement.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-report__note">
        CrewSignal treats this arrangement as a temporary, process-driven solution rather than a completed merger
        integration or final JCBA.
