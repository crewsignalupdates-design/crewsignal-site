      <h2>📌 JCBA Process — In Progress</h2>
      <p>
        Flight attendants at Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are engaged in an ongoing Joint Collective Bargaining
        Agreement (JCBA) process following Alaska’s acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both groups are represented by CWA-AFA, which is responsible for coordinating representation, integration, and
        bargaining strategy across the combined operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of this posting, there is no publicly announced mediation docket, tentative agreement (TA), or bargaining calendar
        specific to the Alaska / Hawaiian JCBA.
      </p>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="context">
      <h2>🗂️ Reported Integration &amp; Bargaining Context</h2>
      <p>
        Public disclosures indicate that the JCBA process is expected to be methodical, reflecting the operational and
        contractual differences between the two carriers and the complexity of integrating seniority, scheduling systems,
        and work rules under the Railway Labor Act (RLA).
      </p>
      <p>
        No formal National Mediation Board (NMB) mediation status has been publicly reported for the Alaska / Hawaiian JCBA
        as of this posting.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="extension">
      <h2>⏳ Contract Extension as an Indicator of Bargaining Horizon</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the broader integration process, Hawaiian’s existing flight attendant agreement has been extended,
        aligning its amendable date with Alaska’s 2028 amendable timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Detailed implications of the extension (including timing, leverage, and contract-architecture effects) will be
        analyzed separately on the Contract Architecture page. It is noted here as part of the publicly observable
        integration process.

      <h2>🗂️ JCBA Process Milestones (Publicly Reported)</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__note">

        mediation status, or timeline forecasts.
