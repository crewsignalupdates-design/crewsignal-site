      <h2>📌 First Contract Negotiations — Early Stage</h2>
      <p>
        Breeze is in a first contract environment following a successful union representation election and certification.
        Public union communications describe member engagement and negotiation-preparation activity typical of first-contract campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of this posting, CrewSignal has not identified a publicly posted full-contract tentative agreement (TA), ratification schedule,
        or a comprehensive bargaining calendar published by the parties.

      <h2>🗂️ Organizing &amp; Representation Milestones (Publicly Reported)</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__note">
        Because this is a first contract situation, certain organizing and representation milestones are publicly observable (campaign launch,
        NMB filing, election, certification) even when bargaining details and timelines are not. The items below reflect procedural developments only
        and do not imply bargaining outcomes or forecasts.
      </p>

      <ul class="cs-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Organizing campaign announced:</strong> Flight attendants announced an organizing campaign with AFA-CWA on
          <strong>January 9, 2024</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Representation application filed (NMB):</strong> AFA-CWA filed for a representation election on
          <strong>January 22, 2024</strong>, invoking the NMB’s services under the Railway Labor Act.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Election certified / certification issued:</strong> The NMB issued a certification on
          <strong>May 8, 2024</strong> (Case No. <strong>R-7624</strong>), certifying AFA-CWA as the representative.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vote margin publicly reported:</strong> Union communications report a
          <strong>76.3%</strong> vote in favor of representation (certified by the NMB on May 7, 2024).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Campaign pace (publicly described):</strong> Public union statements describe the campaign as unusually rapid,
          with the election filing occurring about two weeks after the campaign went public.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="cs-muted">
        Note on organizing costs: CrewSignal has not identified a carrier-specific public disclosure that itemizes the costs of the Breeze organizing campaign
        (e.g., “money spent”) as a standalone figure.

    <section class="cs-report__section" id="first-contract-process">
      <h2>🧭 First Contract Bargaining Process (Context)</h2>
      <p>
        First contracts commonly take extended time because the parties must build an entire agreement from the ground up
        (recognition, scope, scheduling/work rules, compensation, benefits, grievance/arbitration, and union rights), rather than modifying
        an already-amendable agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public Breeze AFA communications reflect early first-contract steps such as member surveys, committee formation, and negotiation training,
        which typically precede or run alongside initial proposal exchange and section-by-section bargaining.
