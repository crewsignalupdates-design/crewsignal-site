      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Amendable Status</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        Air Wisconsin’s Flight Attendant agreement became amendable in 2022. Under the Railway Labor Act,
        this places the parties in a successor-agreement bargaining posture while the existing contract
        remains in effect absent a ratified replacement.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Historical Negotiation Context</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        AFA-CWA has represented Air Wisconsin Flight Attendants through multiple operational eras,
        including long-standing regional feeder flying arrangements. Public records reflect that a
        tentative agreement summary circulated in August 2020, prior to the current amendable period.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Recent Public Activity &amp; Union Updates</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        Publicly available, Air Wisconsin-specific bargaining detail since the contract became amendable
        has been limited. In August 2022, the AFA Negotiating Committee presented a formal contract opener
        to management outlining member priorities and bargaining scope.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        In 2025, Air Wisconsin announced significant operational changes, including the end of scheduled
        flying under its American Airlines capacity-purchase agreement and a pivot toward charter and
        Essential Air Service operations. Union communications emphasized workforce uncertainty during
        this transition, a factor that may influence bargaining dynamics.
