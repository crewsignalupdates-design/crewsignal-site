        <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
        This Mediation Update is based solely on publicly available information,
        including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant
        mediation agencies, as of the report date. It is prepared for informational
        purposes for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted
        as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
        CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal
        talks, tentative agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when
        evaluating labor dispute developments.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        The week ending 2025.12.19 reflected a steady and externally quiet mediation
        environment across the U.S. airline labor landscape. No new mediation
        referrals, releases, or tentative agreement announcements were publicly
        disclosed during the reporting period. Existing negotiations continued
        without visible inflection or escalation.
      </p>

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Developments</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>No new mediation cases were publicly referred or released</li>
        <li>No tentative agreements were announced as reaching ratification</li>
        <li>No notices of mediation breakdown or progression toward self-help were disclosed</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        Negotiations currently under mediation appear to remain in incremental
        positioning phases, with no externally visible resolution milestones.

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Tangential / Contextual Notes</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        Late-year mediation pauses remain consistent with historical bargaining
        patterns, as negotiating committees, agencies, and carriers transition
        toward early-year scheduling and strategic resets. The absence of
        announcements during this period does not imply inactivity, but rather a
        temporary reduction in externally visible markers.
