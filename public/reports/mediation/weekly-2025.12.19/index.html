    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available information,
    including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant mediation agencies,
    as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be
    interpreted as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal talks, tentative
    agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when evaluating labor dispute developments.

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The week ending 2025.12.19 reflected a steady and externally quiet mediation environment across the U.S.
    airline labor landscape. No new mediation referrals, releases, or tentative agreement announcements were
    publicly disclosed during the reporting period. Existing negotiations continued without visible inflection
    or escalation.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Late-year quiet windows are common in mediation-driven bargaining. The absence of public markers should be
    treated as a continuity signal rather than a conclusion: internal caucusing, scheduling, and package work
    can continue without external visibility until parties choose to message progress or posture changes.
  </p>

  <div class="cs-report__callout">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Negotiation watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Posture changes:</strong> Any shift in union/company messaging from “ongoing” to deadlines, impasse language, or release requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Process movement:</strong> New mediation dates, cancelled sessions, or signs the NMB is intensifying involvement.</li>
      <li><strong>Escalation indicators:</strong> Picketing cadence, strike authorization messaging, or operational strain translating into leverage.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    No new mediation cases were publicly referred or released during this reporting window. No tentative agreements
    were announced as reaching ratification, and no notices of mediation breakdown or progression toward self-help
    were disclosed. Negotiations currently under mediation appear to remain in incremental positioning phases, with
    no externally visible resolution milestones.
