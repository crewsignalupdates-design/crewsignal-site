      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Origins and Scope of the Railway Labor Act</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Railway Labor Act</strong> was enacted in 1926 for interstate railroads
        and extended to airlines in 1936, decades before the modern National Labor
        Relations Act (NLRA) framework for most private-sector workers. The statute
        was written with a very specific policy goal in mind: keep essential
        transportation running by making major strikes and lockouts rare, highly
        structured, and politically visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        For airlines, the RLA governs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Representation and system-wide bargaining units;</li>
        <li>Collective bargaining and contract amendments under
            <a href="#section-6-cycle">Section 6</a>;</li>
        <li>Procedures for <a href="#nmb-mediation">mediation</a>,
            arbitration, and fact-finding;</li>
        <li>Conditions for strikes, lockouts, and other forms of self-help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unlike private-sector bargaining under the NLRA where contracts expire,
        RLA agreements become <em>amendable</em>. The existing contract remains in
        force while the parties move through the full statutory sequence:
        direct talks → <a href="#nmb-mediation">mediation</a> →
        <a href="#release-and-cooling-off">possible release</a> →
        <a href="#peb">PEB</a> → self-help.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="section-6-cycle" class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">The Section 6 Bargaining Cycle</h2>
      <p>
        Most airline contract negotiations that attract public attention occur under
        <strong>Section 6</strong>, which governs changes in rates of pay, rules,
        and working conditions. The cycle includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Section 6 Notices:</strong> Formal proposals that open an amendable round.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct bargaining:</strong> The parties attempt voluntary settlement.</li>
        <li><strong>Request for mediation:</strong> Either side may ask the
          <a href="#nmb-mediation">NMB</a> to intervene when progress stalls.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once mediation begins, neither party may legally initiate self-help.
        The dispute falls under the NMB’s jurisdiction and stays there until
        the Board determines mediation is exhausted.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="nmb-mediation" class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">National Mediation Board and Mediation</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>National Mediation Board (NMB)</strong> administers representation
        and conducts mediation. In major airline disputes its practical influence
        is substantial: the Board effectively controls the pace and timing of
        bargaining once mediation is triggered.
      </p>
      <p>
        In mediation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assigned mediators set schedules and manage proposal flow.</li>
        <li>Confidentiality rules are enforced, shaping public
            union and management communications.</li>
        <li>The Board may prolong mediation for years if it believes a voluntary
            agreement is still possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The NMB cannot impose a contract. Its authority comes from controlling
        the calendar and from the power to recommend
        <a href="#release-and-cooling-off">release from mediation</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="release-and-cooling-off" class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Release and the 30-Day Cooling-Off Period</h2>
      <p>
        The NMB’s most consequential step is whether to “release” the parties
        from mediation. After rejecting arbitration, the dispute enters a
        <strong>30-day cooling-off period</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self-help is prohibited;</li>
        <li>High-pressure bargaining often continues;</li>
        <li>The President may appoint a
            <a href="#peb">Presidential Emergency Board</a> if required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If 30 days expire without a PEB, the parties reach a true self-help
        window — though political reality often intervenes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="peb" class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Presidential Emergency Boards (PEBs)</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Presidential Emergency Board (PEB)</strong> is the final structured
        step before full self-help. When appointed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any strike or lockout is enjoined;</li>
        <li>A neutral board conducts hearings and issues recommendations;</li>
        <li>The final report carries major political and practical weight.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Historically, PEBs have been rare but decisive. A well-known example is the
        dispute involving <strong>American Airlines pilots in the late 1990s</strong>,
        where a PEB’s findings — followed by federal court enforcement — effectively
        ended the strike and redirected the dispute back toward a mediated resolution.
      </p>

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Single-Carrier and Representation Issues</h2>
      <p>
        The RLA uniquely governs representation and <strong>single-carrier
        determinations</strong>, especially relevant during mergers. The NMB decides
        when carriers have integrated sufficiently to form a single unit, which
        then drives representation, contract sequencing, and the start of joint
        bargaining for merged work groups.
      </p>

    <section id="patterns-precedent" class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Patterns and Precedent in Airline Cases</h2>
      <p>
        Several broad patterns characterize modern airline RLA practice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reluctance to release:</strong> The NMB rarely releases
            large airline groups due to systemic risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended mediation:</strong> Airline mediation commonly lasts years.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar as leverage:</strong> Adjusting session pace signals
            the Board’s assessment of the parties’ reasonableness.</li>
        <li><strong>PEBs as last resort:</strong> Used only when a nationwide
            transportation interruption is politically unacceptable.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="implications-current-disputes"
             class="cs-report__section cs-report__section--outlook">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Practical Implications for Current Disputes</h2>
      <p>
        For observers tracking ongoing airline negotiations, understanding the
        RLA structure helps interpret developments: Section 6 notices,
        <a href="#nmb-mediation">mediation</a> updates,
        talk of <a href="#release-and-cooling-off">release</a>,
        or warnings about a potential <a href="#peb">PEB</a> all refer to
        specific actions defined by statute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a dispute sits on the RLA timeline — open Section 6 round, active
        mediation, nearing proffer, cooling-off, or within PEB risk range — is
        often more predictive than any public messaging from either party.
