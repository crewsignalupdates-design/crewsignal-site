    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Key Takeaways (YTD 2025)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        United Flight Attendants entered 2025 still in NMB mediation after filing
        for federal mediation in 2023, with no raises since 2020 and pay
        lagging key industry peers.
      </li>
      <li>
        A Tentative Agreement (TA) was reached in May 2025 that featured
        substantial first-year economic improvements, including higher base pay,
        retro pay, and boarding pay.
      </li>
      <li>
        On July 29, 2025, Flight Attendants rejected the TA by a wide margin,
        with very high turnout, sending the dispute back into mediation with a
        clear directive to address unresolved quality-of-life and work-rule
        issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        Through the fall, AFA pivoted toward a “TA2” strategy that focuses on
        targeted fixes—particularly scheduling, reserve rules, hotels, and
        benefits—rather than a wholesale rewrite of the economic framework.
      </li>
      <li>
        By early November, AFA had presented a focused package of proposals to
        United management, with additional mediation/bargaining dates scheduled
        into December 2025 and early 2026.
      </li>
      <li>
        As of the week ending November 14, 2025, negotiations remain active and
        structured under the Railway Labor Act, with no release from mediation
        and no strike deadline in play.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="background" class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Background &amp; Context</h2>
    <p>
      United Flight Attendants, represented by the Association of Flight
      Attendants-CWA (AFA), filed for federal mediation with the National
      Mediation Board (NMB) in 2023 after several years of stagnant pay and
      mounting frustration over scheduling, hotels, and quality-of-life issues.
      Under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), mediation is a formal but non-binding
      process—any agreement must still be voluntarily reached by the parties
      and ratified by the membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      By late 2024, the dispute was docketed at the NMB and a mediator assigned.
      Through 2024 and into early 2025, AFA relied on a mix of mediated
      sessions, direct bargaining, “from the table” updates, and system-wide
      mobilization to push toward an agreement that could gain majority support
      across a large and diverse Flight Attendant group.
    </p>

  <section id="phase-1" class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
      Phase 1 – Mediation Builds Toward a Tentative Agreement (Jan–May 2025)
    </h2>
    <p>
      In early 2025, mediation and direct bargaining intensified. AFA’s public
      communications emphasized several core goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Significant base pay increases designed to deliver industry-competitive,
        if not industry-leading, top-of-scale rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compensation for more of Flight Attendants’ on-duty time, including
        boarding and ground time that had historically gone unpaid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved scheduling rules, limits on excessive sit time, and stronger
        protections around redeye operations, crew rest, and reserve life.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stronger contract language on hotels, improved benefits, and better
        long-term retirement security.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      On May 23, 2025, AFA and United announced a Tentative Agreement covering
      roughly 28,000 United Flight Attendants. Public statements from both
      AFA and United characterized the deal as “industry-leading” on pay, with
      meaningful retroactive compensation and new boarding pay provisions.
      Aviation and business media framed the TA as aiming to bring United cabin
      crew broadly in line with major-industry peers on headline economics.
    </p>

  <section id="phase-2" class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
      Phase 2 – Ratification Campaign and Member Concerns (May–July 2025)
    </h2>
    <p>
      Following the announcement of the TA, AFA launched an intensive
      ratification campaign, including roadshows, virtual meetings, FAQs and
      detailed summaries. These materials highlighted wage increases, boarding
      pay, the retro pay structure, scheduling provisions, hotel language, and
      proposed changes to benefits and retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Member feedback, however, revealed significant concern in several areas:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Whether the TA adequately addressed long sit times and unpaid ground
        time between segments.
      </li>
      <li>
        The treatment of redeye flying, including the stacking of multiple
        redeyes and the impact on rest and safety.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reserve life, including Reserve Availability Periods (RAPs), scheduling
        predictability, and the ability to pick up additional flying on days
        off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Benefit thresholds, such as the 480-hour requirement for
        employer-subsidized health care, and whether these rules were
        appropriately updated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whether the economic framework fully reflected years of inflation and
        the extended time spent under an amendable agreement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Voting on the TA ran through July and was supported by substantial
      communications from both the union and the company, as well as
      significant discussion and analysis from industry observers.

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
      Phase 3 – TA Rejected, Mediation Re-Centers the Dispute (Late July–August 2025)
    </h2>
    <p>
      On July 29, 2025, United Flight Attendants voted to reject the Tentative
      Agreement. Turnout was exceptionally high, and a strong majority voted
      “No,” sending a clear message to the Master Executive Council (MEC) and
      negotiating committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      AFA framed the result as democracy in action and emphasized that, while
      the TA delivered meaningful economic gains, members were unconvinced that
      the package fully met their expectations for pay, scheduling, and
      quality-of-life improvements. Media coverage focused on ongoing concerns
      about pay for all hours worked, schedule flexibility, and work rules,
      even in the face of significant wage increases and retro pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      By early August, the United MEC outlined a plan to return to the
      bargaining table with United management, supported by the NMB mediator.
      Rather than immediately seeking release from mediation, the union signaled
      its intent to continue working within the RLA framework to secure a
      revised agreement that could be ratified.
    </p>

  <section id="phase-4" class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
      Phase 4 – Reset with the Mediator and New Dates (September–October 2025)
    </h2>
    <p>
      On September 15, AFA and United met with the federal mediator to plan
      next steps after the TA’s rejection. A union update the following day
      reported that new mediation and bargaining dates had been secured. While
      additional sessions were initially expected to occur later in the year,
      some dates were moved forward into late October as the parties sought to
      maintain momentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an October 3 update, AFA noted that bargaining scheduled for October
      29–31 would proceed despite a federal government shutdown, even if the
      mediator’s ability to attend in person was limited. United agreed to
      continue negotiations in the mediator’s absence, a notable shift from
      earlier insistence on mediator-chaired sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this period, AFA and outside commentators continued to stress
      that United Flight Attendants remained behind important comparators on
      total compensation and that members expected a “true industry-leading”
      agreement that combined pay, boarding pay, and improved work rules.
    </p>

  <section id="phase-5" class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">
      Phase 5 – Targeted Proposals for a Revised TA (TA2) (Oct 29–Nov 14, 2025)
    </h2>
    <p>
      From October 29–31, 2025, AFA’s negotiating committee met with United
      management to begin structured work on a revised Tentative Agreement
      (“TA2”). A November 3 update described this session as the start of a
      targeted, problem-solving phase aimed at fixing the issues that drove the
      “No” vote while preserving the core economic gains in the original TA.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to that update, AFA presented a focused package of proposals
      that included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Scheduling improvements</strong> – a sit-time “rig” to compensate
        for long ground time between segments and incentivize more efficient
        pairings; clearer protections around redeye flying; and limits on
        requirements to check company systems during layovers and after flight
        segments, along with improved notification rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reserve issues</strong> – refinement of Reserve Availability
        Periods (RAPs), how they can be used by the company, and additional
        flexibility for reserves to pick up on days off, building on reserve
        changes from the first TA.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hotels and lodging</strong> – more explicit contract language
        around hotel standards (including quality, location, and alignment with
        pilot hotel lists), reflecting member concerns that hotel provisions in
        TA1 needed further strengthening.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Benefits and retirement</strong> – concepts such as a Retiree
        Health Care Reimbursement Account (RHRA) funded in part by unused sick
        leave to help bridge healthcare costs, and efforts to address the
        480-hour threshold for employer-subsidized healthcare.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Economic issues</strong> – AFA indicated that full economic
        proposals (rates, retro structure, profit-sharing) would be presented
        in subsequent sessions, consistent with standard practice of aligning
        final economic asks with up-to-date industry and company conditions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The November 3 update characterized the October session as productive and
      noted that both parties appeared committed to reaching an agreement. At
      the same time, AFA cautioned that management remained resistant to
      significantly expanding the overall economic value of the deal. In that
      context, a realistic TA2 path likely involves targeted improvements and
      reallocations within a similar economic framework rather than a dramatic
      increase in total cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of mid-November, additional bargaining and/or mediation dates have
      been set for December 9–12, 2025 and into early 2026, providing a defined
      schedule for continued talks under NMB oversight.

      Status as of Week Ending November 14, 2025
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through the week ending November 14, 2025, the United / AFA dispute
      remains firmly within the Railway Labor Act mediation framework:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first Tentative Agreement has been rejected, but its economic
        structure—base pay increases, boarding pay, and retro pay—remains the
        most likely baseline for any TA2.
      </li>
      <li>
        No release from mediation has been requested or granted, and there is
        no strike deadline in effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        The parties have completed their first post-rejection bargaining
        session focused on targeted issues, with additional sessions scheduled.
      </li>
      <li>
        AFA’s strategy is now centered on winning specific improvements in
        scheduling, reserve life, hotels, benefits, and enforcement language,
        while defending core economic gains already secured in TA1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Management appears resistant to substantially expanding the overall
        economic total of the agreement, creating tension between pattern-bargaining
        realities and member expectations for a “true industry-leading” deal.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Practically, Flight Attendants head into the holiday period with no new
      ratified contract in place, but with a clear roadmap of future
      bargaining/mediation dates and heightened attention from both the
      industry and the broader labor community.

      Outlook &amp; Framework for Weekly Updates (Beginning November 21, 2025)
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Year-to-Date Mediation Review establishes the baseline for Crew
      Signal’s ongoing coverage of United / AFA mediation. Beginning with the
      week ending November 21, 2025, weekly updates will track:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Session activity:</strong> What was scheduled, what actually
        occurred, and whether NMB mediators were present.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Proposal movement:</strong> Any documented shifts on scheduling,
        reserve, hotels, benefits, and economics compared with both TA1 and the
        October 29–31 targeted package.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Signals from AFA and United:</strong> Public statements, internal
        union updates, and company communications that indicate hardening or
        softening of positions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Escalation vs. de-escalation:</strong> Any steps toward public
        actions, requests for release, or, conversely, signs of convergence on
        a TA2 framework.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Comparative context:</strong> Developments in other Flight
        Attendant negotiations that influence pattern bargaining and shape
        expectations for United Flight Attendants.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As of November 14, the core question for United Flight Attendants,
      management and the NMB is whether targeted adjustments within the existing
      economic framework can produce a TA2 that members will ratify, or whether
      the dispute will deepen into more intensive mediation and potential
      discussion of release. Crew Signal’s weekly mediation updates will follow
      that trajectory in real time.
