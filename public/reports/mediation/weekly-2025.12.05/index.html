  <!-- Section 1: United–AFA Mediation Status -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">1. United–AFA Mediation Status</h2>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      <strong>Current posture (publicly confirmed).</strong>
      Negotiations between AFA-CWA and United Airlines remain in active mediation under the National Mediation Board
      (NMB). AFA’s public bargaining updates reaffirm that economics and quality-of-life protections remain open items.
      United has acknowledged that bargaining continues and has characterized recent sessions as constructive,
      consistent with Railway Labor Act confidentiality requirements.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      <strong>NMB mediation cadence.</strong>
      There has been no release to a 30-day cooling-off period. Mediation is scheduled to continue into mid-December,
      with the NMB maintaining a structured but moderate cadence, consistent with later-stage bargaining but without
      indications of impasse.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      <strong>CrewSignal assessment.</strong>
      United–AFA remains the highest-visibility, actively mediated flight-attendant contract currently before the NMB.
      While the specifics of in-room discussions remain confidential under the Railway Labor Act, union-side
      communications confirm that primary economic and quality-of-life categories are still open for resolution.

    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">3. December Outlook</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      United/AFA remains the primary mediation track to watch as sessions continue into mid-December. The NMB has
      maintained stability across all active airline mediation cases, with no case approaching a release or cooling-off
      period this week. Industry-wide mediation activity remains steady but without signs of escalation, even as
