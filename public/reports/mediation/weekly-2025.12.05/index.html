    <strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>
    This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available information,
    including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant mediation agencies,
    as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be
    interpreted as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or as a prediction of negotiation outcomes.
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between mediated negotiations, informal talks, tentative
    agreements, and post-agreement implementation phases when evaluating labor dispute developments.

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The week ending 2025.12.05 kept a familiar posture across airline labor mediation: no new high-visibility
    releases or cooling-off periods surfaced publicly, and the “signal set” remained defined by the status and
    cadence of ongoing cases rather than new docket openings. United–AFA continued to stand out as the most
    visible flight-attendant mediation track under the National Mediation Board.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    Across other active airline-industry dockets, public communications largely reflected continuity — steady mediation,
    open economic and quality-of-life sections, and the slow sequencing typical of Railway Labor Act processes. In this
    phase, the most meaningful indicators are procedural posture and cadence: whether parties are meeting, whether proposals
    are moving, and whether the NMB’s involvement appears to be intensifying or stabilizing.
  </p>

  <div class="cs-report__callout">
    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Negotiation watchpoints</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>United–AFA cadence:</strong> Any sign that mediation sessions accelerate, expand in scope, or shift from “constructive” messaging toward impasse language.</li>
      <li><strong>Release / cooling-off:</strong> Whether any airline labor case approaches an NMB release that starts the formal 30-day clock.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality-of-life leverage:</strong> Public emphasis on scheduling, reserve policy, fatigue, and hotel standards as indicators of where pressure is concentrating.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>United–AFA mediation status:</strong> Negotiations between AFA-CWA and United Airlines remained in active mediation under the NMB.
    Union-side updates continued to frame economics and quality-of-life protections as open items, while United’s public posture
    acknowledged ongoing bargaining and characterized sessions as constructive — consistent with Railway Labor Act confidentiality
    constraints. No release to a 30-day cooling-off period was indicated during this reporting window, and mediation was described
    as continuing into mid-December.
  </p>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    <strong>Other active airline-industry mediation tracks:</strong> Several pilot and related workgroups remained in publicly confirmed mediation
    with no visible escalation signals. Public-facing themes across those tracks continued to cluster around compensation alignment,
    scheduling stability, reserve utilization, fatigue mitigation, retention, and workplace standards — with no indication this week that
    the NMB had shifted any case into an accelerated endgame posture.
  </p>

  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li><strong>Allegiant — ALPA (Pilots):</strong> Mediation remains active; public themes include scheduling stability, duty-day concerns, and compensation alignment.</li>
    <li><strong>Hawaiian — ALPA (Pilots):</strong> Mediation continues with economic sections described publicly as still open, alongside incremental progress signals.</li>
    <li><strong>Mesa — ALPA (Pilots):</strong> Public bargaining priorities emphasize retention, wage progression, and training pipeline stability; no release/escalation noted.</li>
    <li><strong>PSA Airlines — ALPA (Pilots):</strong> Public messaging highlights staffing incentives, reserve utilization, and fatigue mitigation; mediation remains active.</li>
    <li><strong>Envoy Air — IAM (Fleet &amp; Ground):</strong> Ongoing NMB-mediated negotiations with economics and workplace standards cited in public updates.</li>
    <li><strong>Other open dockets:</strong> Piedmont / ALPA (Pilots) remained quiet publicly; Alaska / ALPA referenced limited NMB involvement on implementation-phase matters.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3 class="cs-report__callout-title">Crew Signal mediation &amp; negotiation read – 2025.12.05</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>United–AFA:</strong> Still the most visible FA mediation track; continuity posture with economics/QOL open and no cooling-off signals.</li>
      <li><strong>Other airline cases:</strong> Broad stability across active dockets; public themes cluster around pay alignment, scheduling, fatigue, and retention.</li>
      <li><strong>System-wide:</strong> The key indicator remains NMB posture shift — cadence and language changes typically precede any formal release movement.</li>

  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">What We’re Watching Next</h2>

  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li>United–AFA: any publicly signaled change in mediation cadence, scope, or bargaining posture as sessions continue into mid-December.</li>
    <li>Any NMB indicators that an airline labor case is moving toward <strong>release</strong> and a formal 30-day cooling-off period.</li>
    <li>New public proposal movement — especially on quality-of-life items (reserve policy, duty-day limits, hotel standards, rest).</li>
    <li>Escalation signals that convert bargaining strain into operational risk (picketing cadence, staffing stress, reliability impacts).</li>
