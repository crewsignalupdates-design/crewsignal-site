<p>RLA Mediation · Weekly Snapshot</p>

<h1>Week of 2025.12.05</h1>

<p>
  United–AFA dominated the airline mediation landscape this week, with other
  NMB airline cases holding steady and no major new high-visibility dockets
  posted. The focus remains on how existing mediated disputes evolve rather
  than on fresh filings.
</p>

<p>
  Coverage date: 2025.12.05 &nbsp;&nbsp; Framework: Railway Labor Act
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Focus: Airline &amp; related sectors
</p>

<h2>1. United–AFA Mediation Status</h2>

<h3>Current Posture (Publicly Confirmed)</h3>
<p>
  Negotiations between AFA-CWA and United Airlines remain in active mediation
  under the National Mediation Board (NMB). AFA’s public bargaining updates
  reaffirm that economics and quality-of-life protections remain open items.
  United has acknowledged that bargaining continues and has characterized
  recent sessions as constructive, consistent with Railway Labor Act
  confidentiality requirements.
</p>

<h3>NMB Mediation Cadence</h3>
<p>
  There has been no release to a 30-day cooling-off period. Mediation is
  scheduled to continue into mid-December, with the NMB maintaining a
  structured but moderate cadence, consistent with later-stage bargaining but
  without indications of impasse.
</p>

<h3>CrewSignal Assessment</h3>
<p>
  United–AFA remains the highest-visibility, actively mediated
  flight-attendant contract currently before the NMB. While the specifics of
  in-room discussions remain confidential under the Railway Labor Act,
  union-side communications confirm that primary economic and
  quality-of-life categories are still open for resolution.
</p>

  priorities. No release or escalation signals have been issued by the NMB.

  reserve utilization, and fatigue mitigation themes as identified by ALPA in

  centered on economics and workplace standards. No major procedural

<ul>
  <li>
    Piedmont / ALPA — Mediation remains open with no significant public
    updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Alaska / ALPA — Still under limited NMB involvement in certain

<h2>3. December Outlook</h2>
<p>
  United/AFA remains the primary mediation track to watch as sessions continue
  into mid-December. The NMB has maintained stability across all active
  airline mediation cases, with no case approaching a release or cooling-off
  period this week. Industry-wide mediation activity remains steady but
  without signs of escalation.
