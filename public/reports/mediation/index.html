  <!-- NEW SECTION: United / AFA Mediation Status -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">United Airlines / AFA Mediation Status</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      United Airlines flight attendants, represented by the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA), have been in a
      multi-year bargaining and mediation cycle governed by the Railway Labor Act. In August 2024, United flight
      attendants voted 99.99% in favor of strike authorization, sending a strong signal of frustration over pay, duty
      time, and quality-of-life issues. That vote did not trigger an immediate strike, but it established a high-pressure
      backdrop for the next phases of talks.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      In May 2025, United and AFA reached a tentative agreement (TA) that was widely described as “historic,” with
      industry-leading compensation, retroactive pay, and boarding-time pay provisions. Union communications estimated
      roughly a 40% total economic gain in the first year if the agreement were ratified. However, when the TA went to
      the membership in July 2025, 71% voted “no,” with over 90% turnout, sending the parties back to the table under
      NMB oversight.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Since the rejection, the dispute has remained in mediated bargaining. Federal mediators initially indicated that
      their availability to resume formal sessions might be delayed until late 2025, but subsequent updates noted that
      United and AFA were able to secure additional bargaining dates, even amid government shutdown uncertainty. By
      early November 2025, AFA had presented targeted proposals to United management and resumed structured bargaining,
      with the union emphasizing that member priorities would guide any revised agreement.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      As of the week of 2025.11.28, there has been <strong>no NMB release into a 30-day cooling-off period</strong> and
      no declared strike deadline. The parties remain in mediation. For crews, the key themes are:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Strike authorization remains in the background as a leverage signal, but RLA status quo obligations still apply.</li>
      <li>A previously negotiated “industry-leading” TA was rejected, which raises the stakes for any successor agreement.</li>
      <li>Mediator availability, government shutdown dynamics, and union survey results all shape the pace of progress.</li>
      <li>Any later merger or integration moves involving United would be layered on top of this already complex mediation context.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      United / AFA developments will continue to be reflected in weekly mediation snapshots and any future YTD updates,
      with particular attention to NMB posture, release/cooling-off risks, and how contract outcomes intersect with
      broader industry trends in pay, boarding time, and scheduling.
