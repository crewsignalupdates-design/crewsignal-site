    Editor’s Note: This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available information, including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant mediation agencies, as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The week ending 2026.01.09 produced no new publicly visible mediation determinations, releases,
        or structural changes in negotiation posture across major U.S. airline bargaining tracks. Public
        signals remained continuity-oriented, with observable activity concentrated in ongoing execution
        under existing frameworks rather than new procedural escalation.
      </p>

      <h3>Negotiation watchpoints</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Posture changes: any shift in union/company messaging toward deadlines, impasse framing, or release requests.</li>
        <li>Process movement: new mediation dates, cancelled sessions, or signs the NMB is intensifying involvement.</li>
        <li>Escalation indicators: picketing cadence, strike authorization messaging, or operational strain translating into leverage.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Integration tracks and ongoing negotiations already underway continued without new publicly visible inflection points.
        Communications observed during the reporting period emphasized continuity and execution rather than changes in scope,
        sequencing, or mediation posture.
      </p>
