  <!-- Section 1: United–AFA Mediation Status -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">1. United–AFA Mediation Status</h2>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      AFA’s public bargaining update on January 2 confirmed that negotiations with United will continue in federal
      mediation in Chicago on January 6–9, 2026. The update frames the session as the next scheduled step in ongoing
      bargaining under the National Mediation Board process.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      As of week’s end, there was no public announcement of a tentative agreement or a change in procedural status
      (such as a release to a 30-day cooling-off period). Consistent with Railway Labor Act norms, public disclosures
      did not include detailed package terms or internal proposal language.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      CrewSignal will continue to treat United–AFA as the primary flight-attendant mediation track to monitor, with
      updates limited to verifiable public communications and clearly identified procedural milestones.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2: Other negotiation / mediation signals -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">2. Airline Negotiations Signal Check</h2>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      Public disclosure across airline labor negotiations remains uneven week to week. For accuracy, CrewSignal limits
      this section to documented procedural developments and official updates, rather than inferred bargaining content.
    </p>

    <p class="cs-report__body">
      As the “Mediation &amp; Negotiations” section expands, the hub will include a dedicated “open negotiations” tracker
      organized by union and carrier to provide a durable view of concurrent bargaining load without relying on
      non-public information.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 3: Near-term outlook -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">3. Early-January Outlook</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      The next scheduled United–AFA federal mediation session (January 6–9) is the key near-term calendar anchor. Any
      changes in status will be reflected only after public confirmation from the parties or the NMB process.
    </p>

  <!-- Section 4: Source notes -->
  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">4. Source Notes</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__body">
      This snapshot relies on publicly available union communications regarding scheduled mediation dates and bargaining
      posture. Under the Railway Labor Act, in-room mediation details are confidential unless the parties elect to
      release them publicly.
