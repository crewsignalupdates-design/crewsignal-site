    Editor’s Note: This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available information, including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant mediation agencies, as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.

  <p class="cs-report__disclaimer">
    CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between confirmed procedural events (scheduled sessions, status indicators, and documented process changes) and speculative outcomes (proposal content or likely settlement terms) absent primary disclosure.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The week ending 2026.01.02 featured a publicly confirmed scheduling update for the next United / CWA-AFA federal
        mediation block, identified as January 6–9, 2026 in Chicago. The confirmation indicates that bargaining remained
        in active, NMB-supervised mediation at the start of 2026, with no public procedural escalation signals issued
        during the reporting period.

        <li>The January 6–9 federal mediation block as the near-term calendar anchor, including any publicly confirmed status change.</li>
        <li>Whether additional 2026 mediation dates are scheduled in closer succession (cadence changes can be a signal).</li>

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>United / CWA-AFA:</strong> A public union update indicated that negotiations with United will continue in federal
        mediation in Chicago on January 6–9, 2026. As of week’s end, there was no public announcement of a tentative agreement
        and no disclosed procedural status change (such as a release to a 30-day cooling-off period).
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Disclosure posture:</strong> Consistent with Railway Labor Act norms, public communications did not include detailed
        package terms or in-room proposal language. CrewSignal will continue to limit updates to verifiable public communications
        and clearly identified procedural milestones.
      </p>
