        Editor’s Note: This Mediation report is based solely on publicly available regulatory, company, and union-source
        information as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted

        CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between confirmed procedural events (scheduled sessions, status indicators, and
        documented process changes) and speculative outcomes (proposal content, likely settlement terms) absent primary disclosure.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        The week ending 2026.01.02 featured a confirmed scheduling update for the next United / CWA-AFA federal mediation
        block, publicly identified as January 6–9, 2026 in Chicago. The confirmation keeps the dispute in active,
        NMB-supervised bargaining at the start of 2026. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__body">
        <strong>United / CWA-AFA:</strong> A public union update confirmed that negotiations with United will continue in
        federal mediation in Chicago on January 6–9, 2026. As of week’s end, there was no public announcement of a tentative
        agreement or a change in procedural status (such as a release to a 30-day cooling-off period). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__body">
        <strong>Disclosure posture:</strong> Consistent with Railway Labor Act norms, public communications did not include
        detailed package terms or in-room proposal language. CrewSignal will continue to limit updates to verifiable public
        communications and clearly identified procedural milestones.
