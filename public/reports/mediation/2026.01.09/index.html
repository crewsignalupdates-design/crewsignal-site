        This report summarizes publicly disclosed mediation-session scheduling and postures for major open bargaining tracks.
        CrewSignal distinguishes between <strong>confirmed procedural events</strong> (dates, sessions, actions) and
        <strong>speculative outcomes</strong> (proposal content, likely settlement terms) absent primary disclosure.

      <p class="cs-report__body">
        United Airlines and the Association of Flight Attendants–CWA (CWA-AFA) conducted a scheduled block of
        <strong>federal mediation sessions in Chicago</strong> during the week of <strong>January 6–9, 2026</strong>,
        as publicly communicated in union negotiations updates.
      </p>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">What is confirmed</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          A mediation session block was scheduled and conducted for <strong>January 6–9, 2026 (Chicago)</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          The union publicly identified a priorities agenda including: sit rig; targeted scheduling improvements (including
          electronic notification and redeye flying); improved RAPs; tightened hotel language; and contract enforcement.
        </li>
        <li class="cs-report__list-item">
          As of the report date, no public tentative agreement or formal “release” from mediation was announced.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="cs-report__subhead">Analytical significance</h3>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        The occurrence of a multi-day mediation block indicates continued engagement under the Railway Labor Act (RLA)
        process and a continuing “work-the-process” posture. The absence of public proposal detail is normal mid-cycle
        and should not be read as either progress or stagnation without additional indicators (cadence changes, clustered
        sessions, mediated “package” movement, or formal procedural shifts).
