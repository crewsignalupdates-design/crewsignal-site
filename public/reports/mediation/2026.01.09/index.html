      <p class="cs-report__disclaimer">
        Editor’s Note: This Mediation report is based solely on publicly available regulatory, company, and union-source
        information as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted
        as investment advice or as a prediction of bargaining outcomes.
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__lede">
        CrewSignal distinguishes carefully between scheduled mediation activity (dates, sessions, and procedural status),
        negotiations messaging (public priorities and framing), and verifiable bargaining outcomes (tentative agreements,
        ratifications, and formal process changes).

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p class="cs-report__body">
        The week ending 2026.01.09 included a scheduled mediation session block between United Airlines and CWA-AFA.
        While detailed bargaining proposals were not publicly disclosed, the occurrence of a multi-day session is a
        meaningful process signal indicating continued engagement in the Railway Labor Act mediation track. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>

      <p class="cs-report__body">
        <strong>United / CWA-AFA:</strong> The parties conducted a scheduled block of mediation sessions during
        January 6–9, 2026. The union’s public communications emphasized priorities including sit rig, targeted
        scheduling improvements (including electronic notification and redeye flying), improved RAPs, tightened hotel
        language, and contract enforcement. No tentative agreement or formal release from mediation was publicly
        announced during the reporting period. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>

      <p class="cs-report__body">
        <strong>Process posture:</strong> The session block indicates an active “work-the-process” posture consistent with
        mid-cycle RLA mediation, where confidentiality and limited post-session disclosure are common. Standing alone, the
        absence of public proposal detail should not be treated as a proxy for progress or impasse.
