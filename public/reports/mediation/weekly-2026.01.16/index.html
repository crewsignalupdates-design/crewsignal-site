    Editor’s Note: This Mediation &amp; Negotiation report is based solely on publicly available information, including statements from labor organizations, employers, and relevant mediation agencies, as of the report date. It is prepared for crew and labor-focused readers and should not be interpreted as legal advice, bargaining guidance, or a prediction of negotiation outcomes.

      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The week ending 2026.01.16 did not produce new publicly visible mediation determinations, releases,
        or formal procedural changes across active airline bargaining tracks. Ongoing negotiations continued
        under existing frameworks, with no publicly announced transitions to cooling-off periods, self-help
        authorization, or arbitration pathways observed during the reporting period.
      </p>

      <h3>Negotiation watchpoints</h3>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Posture changes: any shift in union/company messaging toward deadlines, impasse framing, or release requests.</li>
        <li>Process movement: new mediation dates, cancelled sessions, or signs the NMB is intensifying involvement.</li>
        <li>Escalation indicators: picketing cadence, strike authorization messaging, or operational strain translating into leverage.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">This Week’s Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Public communications observed during the week remained largely continuity-oriented. Where mediation is active,
        visible signals continued to reflect process continuation rather than structural escalation or resolution markers.
        No new publicly disclosed releases, impasse findings, or ratification timelines were identified during the reporting period.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a labor-facing lens, the most relevant near-term indicators remain changes in cadence (session frequency),
        shifts in messaging that suggest narrowing or sequencing progress, and any explicit “process change” language that
        can precede formal escalation.
      </p>
