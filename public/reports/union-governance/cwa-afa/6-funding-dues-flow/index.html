    <h2>1. The Foundational Detail</h2>
    <p>
      AFA dues are assessed as a <strong>flat monthly amount</strong>, rather than as a percentage
      of gross wages. At the time of writing, the commonly cited rate is
      <strong>$50 per month</strong>. This flat-rate approach distinguishes AFA from many unions
      whose dues scale directly with income.
    </p>
    <p class="cs-note">
      This report focuses on structural flow and allocation. Dollar amounts and percentages
      should always be verified against current governing documents and LM filings.
    </p>

  <section class="cs-block">
    <h2>2. Dues Flow Upward</h2>
    <p>
      Member dues flow upward from local councils to AFA–CWA and then to CWA National through
      per-capita mechanisms. While exact allocations vary by year and policy, the overall
      structure follows a consistent pattern.

    <h2>3. Why Retention Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Retention levels shape the functional capacity of each layer. Local retention affects
      day-to-day representation and responsiveness. AFA retention supports national bargaining,
      industry programs, and cross-carrier coordination. CWA National retention funds broader
      organizing efforts, political activity, and compliance infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later reports in this series will use verified filings to compare how different flight
      attendant unions allocate resources across representation, bargaining, and enforcement.

    <h2>4. Verification Path</h2>
    <p>
      The primary public verification tools for union funding and expenditures are the
      Department of Labor’s LM filings:
      <strong>LM-2</strong> (large organizations),
      <strong>LM-3</strong>, and
      <strong>LM-4</strong> (smaller organizations).
    </p>
    <p>
      CrewSignal maintains a dedicated filings library with direct links and summarized extracts
      for reference and comparison.
