    <h2>3. Key Items Flagged</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      These flags highlight LM-2 categories that are material, structurally informative, or comparability-relevant.
      Flags are descriptive and anchored to specific LM-2 items/schedules.
    </p>

    <h3>Flag A — “Dues” do not appear as receipts on the national LM-2</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Dues and Agency Fees (Item 36):</strong> $0</li>
      <li><strong>Other Receipts (Item 48):</strong> $28,114,551</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      This presentation matters for comparability: a large share of receipts are reported through “Other Receipts” rather than “Dues and Agency Fees.”
      Readers should treat this as a reporting-structure signal, not as an absence of member-funded revenue.
      Source: Statement B Items 36 and 48. 
    </p>

    <h3>Flag B — Parent-body funding is explicitly itemized in Schedule 14 (Other Receipts)</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Named payer:</strong> Communications Workers of America (classified as “Affiliate Labor Union”)</li>
      <li><strong>Four “CWA CONTRIBUTION” entries:</strong> $250,000 each (10/31/2023; 11/30/2023; 02/29/2024; 05/31/2024)</li>
      <li><strong>“FUNDING FROM AFFILIATE FYE 2024”:</strong> $26,166,633 (05/31/2024)</li>
      <li><strong>Total with this payer (Schedule 14):</strong> $27,166,633</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      This is a direct, itemized indicator of the parent/subordinate financial relationship as presented in the filing’s receipts.
      Source: Schedule 14 entry for “COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA.” 
    </p>

    <h3>Flag C — CWA also appears as a major payee in Overhead (Schedule 18)</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Payee:</strong> Communications Workers of America</li>
      <li><strong>Recurring line:</strong> “RENT - AFA OFFICE SPACE” ($22,119 monthly across the period)</li>
      <li><strong>Large transfer line:</strong> “AFA UNSPENT INCOME TRANSFER TO RESERVE” $1,572,848 (05/31/2024)</li>
      <li><strong>Total to this payee on Schedule 18:</strong> $1,838,375</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      This is a second, itemized parent/subordinate touchpoint: the parent body is not only a funding source, but also a major payee for overhead and a large end-of-year transfer described as a reserve transfer.
      Source: Schedule 18 entry for “COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA.” 
    </p>

    <h3>Flag D — Strike / reserve posture is visible as a balance-sheet liability</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Other Liabilities (Schedule 10):</strong> “AMOUNTS HELD FOR STRIKE FUNDS” $1,444,406</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      Source: Schedule 10. 
    </p>

    <h3>Flag E — Legal / professional spending is largely embedded in functional buckets</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Representational Activities (Schedule 15 total):</strong> $19,490,469</li>
      <li><strong>General Overhead (Schedule 18 total):</strong> $2,451,505</li>
      <li><strong>Union Administration (Schedule 19 total):</strong> $1,454,854</li>
      <li><strong>Example itemizations:</strong> multiple law-firm entries under Schedule 15 with “LEGAL REVIEW/CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT” purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      The LM-2 provides some vendor-level itemization, but it does not allocate by carrier/contract or organizing campaign; costs are primarily reported by functional schedule.

    <h2>4. Parent/Subordinate Relationship — What This LM-2 Shows (and What It Does Not)</h2>

    <h3>What is directly visible (itemized)</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Inbound funding from CWA:</strong> $27,166,633 recorded in Schedule 14 (“Other Receipts”).</li>
      <li><strong>Outbound payments to CWA:</strong> Schedule 18 includes recurring rent plus a large year-end “transfer to reserve” to the same payee.</li>
      <li><strong>Affiliation-linked obligations:</strong> Per Capita Tax payments total $1,163,217 (Item 56), but payee detail is not on the Statement B line itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      Source: Schedule 14 and Schedule 18 CWA entries; Statement B Item 56. 
    </p>

    <h3>What cannot be cleanly derived from this LM-2 alone (must be treated as “not determinable here”)</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Net “return” on affiliation:</strong> The filing shows both inbound (Schedule 14) and outbound (Schedule 18 / Item 56) touchpoints, but it does not provide a single reconciled “services received vs. funds remitted” ledger.</li>
      <li><strong>Carrier-by-carrier cost accounting:</strong> Negotiations, enforcement, and organizing are not broken out by airline/contract; they are primarily aggregated under functional schedules (especially Schedule 15).</li>

    <h2>5. Organizing Drives, Joint Initiatives, and Contract Negotiation Load — Visibility Limits in LM-2</h2>

    <h3>Avelo and Breeze organizing outcomes (context)</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Avelo:</strong> Avelo flight attendants voted to join AFA-CWA in 2022 (NMB-certified).</li>
      <li><strong>Breeze:</strong> Breeze flight attendants voted overwhelmingly to join AFA-CWA in 2024 (NMB-certified).</li>
    </ul>

      Public organizing outcomes (context sources): AFA-CWA announcements on Avelo and Breeze.

    <h3>What this LM-2 shows financially about Avelo</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Itemized affiliate funding includes:</strong> “AFA MEC AVELO AIRLINES” — “FUNDING TO AFFILIATE FYE 2024” $47,459.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      This is an example of post-certification affiliate funding appearing as an itemized Schedule 15 payee line (but it is not a total “organizing cost” measure).
      Source: Schedule 15 payee line for “AFA MEC AVELO AIRLINES.” 
    </p>

    <h3>Delta joint organizing drive (AFA-CWA + IAM + others) — what can be said from the LM-2</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Publicly, Delta organizing has been described as a coordinated campaign involving AFA-CWA and IAM (and others).</li>
      <li><strong>In this LM-2:</strong> there is no line item that labels “Delta organizing” as a discrete project cost; costs are absorbed into functional schedules (primarily Schedule 15).</li>
      <li><strong>Delta appears in the filing:</strong> as a named entity with non-itemized amounts in Schedule 14 (“Other Receipts”) and Schedule 19 (“Union Administration”), but these lines do not label an organizing-campaign cost category.</li>

      Delta named-entity presence in this LM-2: see Schedule 14 and Schedule 19 pages listing “DELTA AIR LINES” with non-itemized amounts (no campaign-purpose label on those lines).
    </p>

    <h3>Republic/Mesa joint representation + IBT interaction (context)</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Publicly, the Republic/Mesa merger process includes joint bargaining activity with reference to Teamsters counterparts at Republic.</li>
      <li><strong>In this LM-2:</strong> there is no discrete “Republic/Mesa/IBT pact” cost category; any related negotiation/support costs would be embedded primarily within Schedule 15 representational spending unless separately itemized by payee/purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Mesa-related itemization exists:</strong> Schedule 15 includes “AFA LEC 24088 MESA AIRLINES” funding line ($35,297) and Schedule 15 includes “AFA MEC MESA AIRLINES” funding line ($169,891), but these are affiliate-funding disbursements, not a merger-cost ledger.</li>

    <h3>Multiple contract negotiations, many past amendable dates — how LM-2 presents the cost</h3>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Core point for readers:</strong> this LM-2 does not break negotiation or enforcement costs out by carrier or by contract.</li>
      <li><strong>Instead:</strong> the filing aggregates costs into functional schedules (especially Schedule 15) and into employee/officer allocations to those schedules (many employees are allocated 100% to Schedule 15).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Method and Limits</h2>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      This page cites only what is visible in the filed LM-2. “Anomalies” are treated as reporting-structure signals or
      reconciliation prompts (e.g., dues recorded outside Item 36; parent-body funding/payee touchpoints), not as proof of misconduct.
      Where readers may be tempted to infer net affiliation benefit or campaign-by-campaign cost, this LM-2’s structure generally does not support that inference without additional documents
      (e.g., subsidiary reports, internal budgets, or carrier/council-level statements).
    </p>
    <p class="cs-report__p">
      The clearest parent/subordinate touchpoints in this filing are the itemized CWA receipts in Schedule 14 and the itemized CWA disbursements in Schedule 18.
