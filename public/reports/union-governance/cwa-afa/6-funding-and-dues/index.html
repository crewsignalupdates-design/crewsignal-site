      <h2>Financial Governance</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA operates as a sector-level affiliate within the Communications Workers of America (CWA) structure.
        Financial authority is exercised through sector-level governance mechanisms within constraints set by the
        parent union’s constitutional and administrative framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial governance in this model is defined by (1) the source and routing of dues-derived revenue,
        (2) budget authority and approval pathways, and (3) the degree of autonomy available to sector and
        carrier-level structures for operational spending.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Dues Structure and Revenue Source</h2>
      <p>
        Revenue supporting CWA-AFA operations is primarily derived from member dues and related assessments,
        routed through sector and parent-union systems. Dues flow and retention practices determine how much
        funding remains available for sector-level operations versus parent-union allocations.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Primary revenue source:</strong> member dues and assessments.</li>
        <li><strong>Routing:</strong> revenue flows through sector-level mechanisms within the broader CWA financial structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Implication:</strong> sector operating capacity is sensitive to dues retention and allocation rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Budget Authority and Approval</h2>
      <p>
        Budget authority for CWA-AFA is exercised within the affiliate governance structure, subject to oversight
        and constraints established by the parent union. Approval pathways typically distinguish between routine
        operational expenditures and higher-threshold decisions requiring sector-level or parent-union review.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> sector budgeting for operational functions and representational activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Approval:</strong> sector-level governance approvals with parent-union constraints where applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> delegated spending authority defined by rules, thresholds, and reporting requirements.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Expenditures and Operational Spend</h2>
      <p>
        Operational spending supports bargaining, contract administration, grievance handling, communications,
        and member services. Expenditures reflect the dual nature of CWA-AFA as a carrier-anchored representational
        organization and a subordinate affiliate operating within broader parent-union governance.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Representation and enforcement:</strong> contract administration, grievances, arbitration support.</li>
        <li><strong>Bargaining activity:</strong> negotiations support, mobilization, and communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Administration:</strong> overhead required for sector operations and compliance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Strike and Reserve Funds</h2>
      <p>
        Financial risk provisioning may include strike funds, reserve accounts, or comparable mechanisms. In a
        subordinate affiliate structure, access, governance, and funding levels may be constrained by parent-union
        rules and allocation priorities.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Risk provisioning:</strong> reserves intended to support bargaining leverage and continuity.</li>
        <li><strong>Access conditions:</strong> governance-defined triggers and approval pathways.</li>
        <li><strong>Implication:</strong> reserve effectiveness depends on governance control and liquidity availability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Internal Controls and Accountability</h2>
      <p>
        Internal controls include budgeting discipline, approval thresholds, reporting requirements, and audit
        mechanisms. Accountability operates through both sector-level governance and parent-union oversight
        systems, including compliance requirements tied to statutory disclosures.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Controls:</strong> approval thresholds, documentation standards, and budget variance tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> sector governance bodies plus parent-union review where applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Member visibility:</strong> disclosures and reporting as defined by governance rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Sector operating capacity is shaped by dues routing and parent-union allocation rules.</li>
        <li>Budget autonomy exists within delegated limits and may be overridden by parent-union governance.</li>
        <li>Operational spend is carrier-anchored but financially constrained by affiliate structure.</li>
        <li>Reserve effectiveness depends on governance control, access rules, and funding stability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Statutory Financial Disclosure (LM-2)</h2>
      <p>
        Annual LM-2 filings provide standardized disclosure of revenues, disbursements, officer compensation,
        and major financial categories as required under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA).
