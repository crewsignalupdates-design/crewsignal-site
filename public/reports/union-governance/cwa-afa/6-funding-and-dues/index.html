    <h1 class="cs-report__title">Funding, Dues, and Financial Governance</h1>
    <p class="cs-report__subtitle">
      How CWA-AFA is funded within a union-of-unions model, how sector-level resources are allocated,
      and why proportional benefit cannot be inferred from statutory disclosures alone.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Why This Section Exists</h2>
    <p>
      CWA-AFA does not operate as a dues-collecting national union. Instead, it functions as a sector-level
      organization within the Communications Workers of America (CWA), funded primarily through parent-union
      allocations and governed by internal budget formulas.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section explains how that funding model works, how resources are deployed across multiple carriers,
      and what the LM-2 disclosures do — and do not — reveal about sector-level financial outcomes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>No Direct Dues Collection at the Sector Level</h2>
    <p>
      The CWA-AFA LM-2 reports <strong>$0 in dues and agency fees</strong>. This does not indicate an absence of
      member funding. Rather, it reflects the accounting structure of a sector-level entity that does not
      directly receive payroll deductions from individual members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Member dues are collected upstream and recorded at the parent-union level. CWA-AFA’s operating funds
      appear on the LM-2 as <strong>“Other Receipts”</strong>, primarily consisting of transfers from CWA.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Affiliate Funding from CWA</h2>
    <p>
      CWA-AFA is funded through annual allocations and contributions from CWA. These transfers are reported
      on the LM-2 as itemized “Funding from Affiliate” receipts, supplemented by additional contribution payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LM-2 does not disclose any fixed per-member or percentage-based remittance formula. Instead, it reflects
      the result of CWA’s budgetary decisions for the reporting year.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practical terms, this means that CWA-AFA’s operating budget is:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>derived from member dues already recorded upstream at CWA</li>
      <li>appropriated annually rather than mechanically passed through</li>
      <li>subject to parent-union budget discretion</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Internal Allocation Within CWA-AFA</h2>
    <p>
      Once funding is received, CWA-AFA allocates resources internally across Master Executive Councils (MECs),
      Local Executive Councils (LECs), and national operations using formulas established in the CWA-AFA
      Constitution and bylaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      These formulas govern how sector funds are distributed among carriers based on adjusted dues,
      membership size, and council classification — not on the specific origin of upstream dues dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, there is no direct accounting link between:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>a member’s payroll deduction at a specific carrier, and</li>
      <li>a specific expenditure for negotiations, mediation, or organizing</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Representational Spending Across Multiple Carriers</h2>
    <p>
      CWA-AFA reports substantial expenditures categorized as <strong>Representational Activities</strong>.
      These include funding to multiple carrier MECs, legal and arbitration services, and national support
      functions associated with negotiations, enforcement, and mediation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LM-2 shows representational funding distributed across numerous airlines simultaneously,
      reflecting a sector-wide deployment model rather than carrier-isolated budgeting.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Organizing and Campaign Activity</h2>
    <p>
      Organizing drives and strategic campaigns appear in the LM-2 through a combination of
      representational expenditures, affiliate funding lines, and professional services.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the LM-2 documents the existence and scale of organizing activity, it does not
      identify which members’ dues supported which campaigns, nor does it tie organizing
      expenditures to specific carrier outcomes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Payments Back to CWA</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to receiving funding from CWA, CWA-AFA reports payments back to the parent union
      for per-capita obligations and shared services such as office space, membership processing,
      and administrative support.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting financial relationship is bidirectional:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>CWA → CWA-AFA:</strong> annual funding allocations and contributions</li>
      <li><strong>CWA-AFA → CWA:</strong> per-capita tax and shared-service payments</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Tension in a Majority-Funded Sector</h2>
    <p>
      When a large share of sector funding originates with members of a single carrier,
      prolonged negotiations or mediation at that carrier can raise questions about
      sector-wide prioritization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LM-2 does not provide sufficient detail to determine whether any carrier
      received more or less benefit relative to its contribution. What it does show
      is a funding model that pools resources and deploys them across the sector
      without carrier-specific attribution.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>What Can and Cannot Be Inferred</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>It <strong>can</strong> be inferred that CWA-AFA is funded primarily through parent-union allocations.</li>
      <li>It <strong>can</strong> be inferred that sector-level resources are deployed across multiple carriers.</li>
      <li>It <strong>cannot</strong> be inferred that any carrier’s dues directly funded any specific activity.</li>
