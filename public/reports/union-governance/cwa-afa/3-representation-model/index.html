      <h2>Representation Framework</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA delivers flight attendant representation through a carrier-structured model.
        Representation is organized around carrier councils and base-level leadership rather
        than around independent locals operating under a standalone constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This model is operationally similar to other flight attendant unions in day-to-day
        coverage, while remaining structurally subordinate to the Communications Workers of
        America (CWA) for constitutional and financial authority.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Carrier Councils and Coverage Design</h2>
      <p>
        Representation is typically organized by carrier, with councils or equivalent bodies
        coordinating bargaining, enforcement, and member support within each airline group.
        Carrier-level organization provides a practical boundary for contract administration,
        grievance systems, and dispute escalation.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Carrier boundary:</strong> representation is aligned to a specific employer and contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Council structure:</strong> coordinates representation across bases and operating locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> issues may move from base leadership to council, then to sector/national support.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Base Leadership and Member Contact Points</h2>
      <p>
        Base leadership functions as the primary member contact layer for routine representation.
        Base-level roles typically include local problem resolution, contract interpretation support,
        communication to members, and coordination with council leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        This base layer is the operational interface between members and the larger governance structure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Member Services</h2>
      <p>
        Member services typically include grievance assistance, disciplinary defense support, contract
        enforcement guidance, workplace advocacy, and access to union communications and resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delivery of services is managed within the carrier and base structure, supplemented by sector-level
        coordination and CWA-provided support functions where applicable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Scaling and Resource Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        Coverage scaling depends on membership size, geographic dispersion, and dispute frequency across
        the carrier system. Representation capacity may be supported by a combination of elected leaders,
        appointed representatives, committees, and staff resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because CWA-AFA is a subordinate affiliate, sector-level staffing and financial capacity operate
        within limits set by parent-union governance and affiliate funding mechanisms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>National and Cross-Carrier Support</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA representation is supplemented by sector-level coordination across carriers, particularly
        on common issues such as safety, scheduling enforcement patterns, grievance strategy, and dispute
        escalation. Where national-level legal or administrative support is required, CWA resources may be
        engaged consistent with constitutional and budget controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cross-carrier coordination supports consistency in representation outcomes, while day-to-day services
        remain anchored to carrier and base structures.
      </p>

      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Operational representation is base- and carrier-anchored, similar to other flight attendant unions.</li>
        <li>Sector-level coordination supports consistency across carriers and disputes.</li>
        <li>Resource scaling is constrained by affiliate funding and parent-union governance controls.</li>
        <li>Member interaction is primarily with base and carrier representatives, not national governance bodies.</li>
