      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is a federated labor union representing
        hundreds of thousands of members across multiple sectors and crafts in the United States
        and Canada. It operates as a union of unions, combining geographically based districts
        with industry-specific sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) functions within this structure as a
        national industrial sector. Unlike most CWA affiliates, AFA is not organized through
        CWA’s geographic district system. Instead, it operates through a carrier-based,
        nationwide governance model designed to reflect the operational realities of the
        airline industry.
      </p>

    <p>
  The earliest organized flight attendant union activity in the United States began
  in 1945 when flight attendants at United Airlines formed the Air Line Stewardess
  Association (later the Air Line Stewardesses &amp; Stewards Association) to
  represent their interests in bargaining and workplace conditions. This group is
  widely recognized as the first union representing cabin crew, and its early
  efforts were associated with the Air Line Pilots Association’s steward/stewardess
  division. 
</p>
<p>
  In the early 1970s, flight attendants chose to establish an independent
  Association of Flight Attendants committed to direct member governance and
  unencumbered representation. AFA later received an AFL-CIO charter in the
  1980s and, in 2004, affiliated with the Communications Workers of America
  (CWA), preserving its internal constitutional structure while operating
  as a sector within CWA’s broader framework.

      <p>
        In 2004, AFA affiliated with the Communications Workers of America. That affiliation
        preserved AFA’s internal constitution, representational pipeline, and bargaining
        architecture, while situating the organization within CWA’s broader constitutional
        framework. The result was a hybrid model: an autonomous, industry-specific sector
        operating inside a larger international union.

  <h2>Analytical Significance</h2>
  <p>
    The governance structure of the <strong></strong> (CWA),
    and its relationship with the <strong></strong> (AFA),
    illustrates a distinct union model defined by <em>embedded representation within a larger parent organization</em>.
    Unlike independent single-carrier unions or nationally centralized models, AFA operates as an industrial sector
    nested inside a broader, multi-industry labor federation.
  </p>
  <p>
    As this governance series develops, the CWA–AFA model serves as a critical comparative reference point,
    highlighting how layered authority and parent-union constitutional constraints shape bargaining strategy,
    internal accountability, and member responsiveness differently than the centralized (APFA), federated (IAM),
    decentralized (IBT), or national–divisional (TWU) models examined elsewhere in this series.
