      <h2>Committee Framework</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA utilizes a combination of standing and ad hoc committees to support collective
        bargaining, contract administration, policy coordination, and internal governance.
        Committees operate within authority delegated by the sector organization and subject
        to oversight by the Communications Workers of America (CWA).
      </p>
      <p>
        Committee authority is generally functional and advisory unless specific decision-making
        powers are delegated through sector rules or parent-union governance mechanisms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Bargaining Committees</h2>
      <p>
        Collective bargaining is conducted at the carrier level, with bargaining committees
        established to represent flight attendants in negotiations with individual airlines.
        These committees are typically composed of representatives drawn from affected bases
        and carrier councils.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> representatives from the relevant carrier and bases.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> sector-level alignment on strategy, priorities, and messaging.</li>
        <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> bargaining conducted within parameters set by sector and parent-union governance.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Sector and Parent-Union Coordination</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA coordinates bargaining and contract strategy across carriers through sector-level
        leadership and committees. Where negotiations raise broader legal, financial, or policy
        implications, CWA resources may be engaged to provide legal support, research, or strategic
        guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This coordination centralizes expertise and ensures compliance with parent-union standards,
        while limiting unilateral action at the carrier or committee level.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Contract Administration</h2>
      <p>
        Contract administration responsibilities include grievance handling, contract interpretation,
        disciplinary defense support, arbitration, and enforcement of negotiated agreements. These
        functions are primarily carried out at the carrier and base level.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Grievances:</strong> initiated and processed through carrier and base representatives.</li>
        <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> pursued pursuant to contractual procedures and timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> complex or precedent-setting matters may involve sector or parent-union support.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Member Involvement and Ratification</h2>
      <p>
        Members participate in contract outcomes primarily through ratification votes on negotiated
        agreements. Ratification procedures are conducted at the carrier level and are governed by
        applicable rules and timelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Committees and base representatives serve as the primary communication link between negotiators
        and the membership throughout bargaining and administration phases.
      </p>

      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Committees function as the operational core of bargaining and contract administration.</li>
        <li>Carrier-level organization anchors representation, while sector coordination promotes consistency.</li>
        <li>Parent-union oversight constrains committee autonomy but provides legal and institutional support.</li>
        <li>Effective contract administration depends on base-level capacity and escalation pathways.</li>
      </ul>
