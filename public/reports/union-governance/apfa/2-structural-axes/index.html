    <h2>The Core Design</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s authority architecture is organized around a small number of constitutionally defined bodies.
      The model is intentionally compact: membership elects national officers and base leadership; base
      leadership composes the union’s voting board; and a smaller executive body acts between board sessions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 1: Membership → Elections → Union Authority</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s primary legitimacy pipeline begins with the membership: members elect the national officers and
      elect base leadership that functions as the local governance and service layer. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership</strong> is the source of representational authority and officer legitimacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Base-level elections</strong> populate local leadership and establish the voting composition of the Board.</li>
      <li><strong>National elections</strong> populate executive leadership (the national officers).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This means APFA’s “local” layer is not merely operational — it directly shapes national governance
      because base presidents sit on the voting Board of Directors by design. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 2: The Board of Directors as the Primary Governing Body</h2>
    <p>
      APFA identifies its Board of Directors (BOD) as the body “authorized and empowered” to take lawful action
      consistent with the Constitution to safeguard the union and member rights. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
    </p>
    <p>
      Composition is structurally significant: the Board consists of the four national officers plus
      each Base President. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Board composition:</strong> National President, National Vice President, National Secretary, National Treasurer, and each Base President.</li>
      <li><strong>Board function:</strong> Primary governing authority, including union-wide protective actions consistent with the Constitution.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance signal:</strong> Base presidents serve dual roles (local leadership + national governance votes).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 3: The Executive Committee as the Operating Agent Between Board Sessions</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s Executive Committee (EC) is defined as an agent acting “for and on behalf of” the voting Board of Directors,
      including interpretation of the Constitution subject to Board approval. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
    </p>
    <p>
      The EC consists of the national officers plus five ad hoc members. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Core EC membership:</strong> National President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer</li>
      <li><strong>Additional EC membership:</strong> Five (5) ad hoc members</li>
      <li><strong>Key role:</strong> Operational continuity and constitutional interpretation between Board actions (subject to Board oversight)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 4: The Base Layer as Governance + Service Delivery</h2>
    <p>
      APFA maintains local representation at bases, including Base Presidents, Base Vice Presidents, and Base Council Representatives (BCRs),
      providing day-to-day member support and operational representation. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Base President / Vice President:</strong> Local leadership and representation</li>
      <li><strong>Base Council Representatives (BCRs):</strong> Member services and representational functions (e.g., investigations, grievances, operational support)</li>
      <li><strong>Authority linkage:</strong> Base Presidents also serve as voting members of the national Board of Directors</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 5: Departments, Chairs, and Regional Representatives</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to elected leadership, APFA describes national department chairs and regional representatives as part of its organizational structure,
      providing specialized operational capacity across the system. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>National Department Chairs:</strong> Organize and oversee departmental/committee work established by the Constitution and/or Board authority. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</li>
      <li><strong>Regional Representatives:</strong> Provide representational coverage and support functions across the membership (role definitions vary by policy/department assignment). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Structurally, these roles illustrate a “delegated capacity” layer: specialization and coverage expand without creating a separate constitutional authority center.
    </p>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Clear termination points:</strong> Governance authority concentrates in the Board; operational continuity concentrates in the Executive Committee.</li>
      <li><strong>Local-to-national coupling:</strong> Base Presidents are both local leaders and voting national governors, linking workplace realities directly into the union’s governing body. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}</li>
      <li><strong>Delegation without fragmentation:</strong> Chairs/representatives expand reach while remaining subordinate to the elected governance structure. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}</li>
    </ul>
