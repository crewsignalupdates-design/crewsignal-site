      <h2>I. Financial Overview</h2>
      <p>
        APFA reported total receipts of $14.06 million and total disbursements of $14.01 million for the
        reporting period, with 26,523 active members at period-end. Net assets decreased modestly over
        the year, indicating near-full deployment of annual receipts rather than accumulation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Total Receipts:</strong> $14.06 million</li>
        <li><strong>Total Disbursements:</strong> $14.01 million</li>
        <li><strong>Net Assets (End of Period):</strong> $15.52 million</li>
        <li><strong>Active Membership:</strong> 26,523</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>II. Revenue Structure</h2>
      <p>
        APFA’s operations are overwhelmingly funded by member dues and agency fees. Investment-related income
        and asset sales were secondary sources during the reporting period.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dues and agency fees: $13.01 million</li>
        <li>Interest income: $0.31 million</li>
        <li>Sale of investments and fixed assets: $0.74 million</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>III. Expenditure Allocation &amp; Local Representation Yield</h2>
      <p>
        APFA reported the following functional allocation of total disbursements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Representational Activities:</strong> $8.72 million (62.2%)</li>
        <li>General Overhead: $1.90 million (13.6%)</li>
        <li>Union Administration: $1.77 million (12.7%)</li>
        <li>Benefits: $0.73 million (5.2%)</li>
        <li>Political Activities &amp; Lobbying: $0.25 million (1.8%)</li>
        <li>Direct taxes and other cash disbursements: $0.17 million (≈1.2%)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="cs-report__highlight">
        <strong>Local Representation Yield (first pass):</strong><br />
        Approximately <strong>$0.62 of every $1.00 in dues collected</strong> is allocated to representational
        activity at the national level. This represents the maximum funding pool available for grievance handling,
        arbitration, negotiations, and field-based contract enforcement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>IV. Representational Spend Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Within the representational category, spending is primarily labor-driven:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Employees: $6.87 million</li>
        <li>Officers: $1.06 million</li>
        <li>All other representational disbursements (e.g., legal/arbitration/vendors): $0.74 million</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        LM-2 reporting does not distinguish local versus national staff. However, the dominance of employee compensation
        within representational spending indicates that enforcement capacity is largely staff-based rather than driven
        primarily by political activity or centralized overhead.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>V. Assets, Reserves, and Financial Position</h2>
      <p>
        APFA reported substantial liquid reserves and no long-term debt, providing stability during periods of dispute,
        arbitration, or contract transition.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cash: $1.51 million</li>
        <li>Investments: $14.88 million</li>
        <li>Fixed assets: $1.07 million</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>VI. Governance &amp; Controls</h2>
      <p>
        APFA reported an independent external audit, fidelity bond coverage of $500,000, no contingent liabilities, and
        no pledged or encumbered assets. The next regular officer election is scheduled for 2028.
      </p>

    <section class="cs-report__section cs-report__conclusion">
      <h2>VII. Summary Observations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nearly two-thirds of dues revenue is allocated to representational activity (first-pass yield: ~$0.62 per dues dollar)</li>
        <li>Representational spending is predominantly staff-driven</li>
        <li>APFA maintains substantial reserves alongside low leverage</li>
        <li>LM-2 provides a baseline for future downstream analysis of councils/lodges/districts where separately reportable</li>
