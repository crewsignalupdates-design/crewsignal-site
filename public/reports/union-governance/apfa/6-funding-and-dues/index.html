      How APFA finances representation, controls expenditures, and maintains internal fiscal accountability.

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Why Financial Governance Matters</h2>
    <p>
      In a single-carrier, independent union, financial governance is inseparable from representational
      authority. There is no parent organization to absorb risk, subsidize operations, or impose external
      financial controls. APFA’s ability to negotiate, enforce contracts, and sustain operations depends
      directly on how dues are assessed, budgets are approved, and funds are safeguarded.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Dues Structure and Revenue Source</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s primary revenue source is membership dues collected from American Airlines flight attendants.
      Dues levels and collection mechanisms are governed internally, linking member participation directly
      to the union’s operating capacity.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Primary funding source:</strong> Member dues.</li>
      <li><strong>Carrier scope:</strong> Revenue base is limited to a single employer’s workforce.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance implication:</strong> Budget stability depends on membership size, retention, and compliance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Budget Authority and Approval</h2>
    <p>
      Financial authority in APFA follows the same centralized governance logic as policy authority.
      Budgets are prepared through executive processes but require approval by the union’s governing body,
      tying spending authority to elected leadership rather than staff discretion.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Executive officers develop proposed budgets.</li>
      <li><strong>Approval:</strong> Governing board approval anchors financial decisions in representative authority.</li>
      <li><strong>Control signal:</strong> Major expenditures are not unilateral executive actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Expenditures and Operational Spend</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s expenditures reflect the operational demands of contract negotiation, enforcement, elections,
      member services, and safety oversight. Spending priorities therefore mirror the union’s governance
      commitments rather than diversified external programs.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Negotiations:</strong> Bargaining support, research, and communications.</li>
      <li><strong>Contract administration:</strong> Scheduling support, grievances, arbitration, and compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Elections:</strong> Balloting services and election administration.</li>
      <li><strong>Member services:</strong> Base-level representation and departmental operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Strike and Reserve Funds</h2>
    <p>
      As an independent union, APFA must internally provision for labor actions and financial contingencies.
      Strike and reserve funds are therefore a critical component of financial governance rather than an
      auxiliary feature.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Risk containment:</strong> Reserves protect operational continuity during labor disputes.</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining leverage:</strong> Financial preparedness strengthens negotiating posture.</li>
      <li><strong>Member trust factor:</strong> Adequate reserves signal institutional durability.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Internal Controls and Accountability</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s financial governance framework relies on internal controls embedded in its constitutional
      structure: elected officers, board oversight, and formal reporting obligations. These mechanisms
      substitute for the external fiscal supervision present in federated union systems.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Elected treasurer function:</strong> Financial stewardship is an elected responsibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Board oversight:</strong> Governing body review constrains discretionary spending.</li>
      <li><strong>Member visibility:</strong> Financial reporting supports internal transparency.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Direct accountability:</strong> Members fund the union and elect those who control spending.</li>
      <li><strong>No external backstop:</strong> Independence increases both autonomy and financial risk exposure.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance alignment:</strong> Financial authority mirrors policy authority in its concentration.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency pressure:</strong> Single-carrier funding heightens the importance of member trust.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Statutory Financial Disclosure (LM-2)</h2>

<p class="cs-report__body">
  The U.S. Department of Labor requires many labor organizations to file annual financial disclosure reports under the
  Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). LM-2 filings provide a standardized view of revenue sources,
  disbursement categories, officer compensation, and major spending categories.
