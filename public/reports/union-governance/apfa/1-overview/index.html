      Origins, independence, and the governance model of a single-carrier flight attendant union.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) is a single-carrier, independent labor
      organization representing flight attendants at American Airlines. Its governance, authority,
      and representational scope are entirely coterminous with one employer, producing a compact and
      centralized institutional design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike federated or sector-based unions, APFA’s authority is not shared with or constrained by
      a parent organization. All bargaining, financial, and constitutional powers are vested within
      the union itself and exercised solely on behalf of American Airlines flight attendants.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Origins and Independence</h2>
    <p>
      APFA was founded in 1977 following internal dissatisfaction with the limits of flight attendant
      representation within larger, multi-craft labor organizations. Flight attendants at American
      Airlines sought autonomous bargaining authority, direct control over union finances, and a
      governance structure designed specifically around flight attendant work rules and career
      realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting organization was intentionally independent. APFA is not affiliated with a
      national labor federation and does not operate as a subordinate body within a larger union
      structure. Its independence is structural rather than symbolic, defining the union’s authority
      relationships and decision-making processes.
    </p>

    <h2>Single-Carrier Governance Model</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Representation of one employer: American Airlines</li>
      <li>A single master collective bargaining agreement</li>
      <li>One national membership body</li>
      <li>A unified constitutional and by-law framework</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This model eliminates external governance layers and ensures that all policy and bargaining
      decisions are made within a single organizational context.
    </p>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Core Governance Structure</h2>

    <h3>National Officers</h3>
    <p>
      APFA’s national officers are elected directly by the membership and exercise executive authority
      on behalf of the union. These officers serve as APFA’s legal representatives and lead contract
      negotiations with the carrier.
    </p>

    <h3>Board of Directors</h3>
    <p>
      The Board of Directors is composed of representatives elected at each flight attendant base.
      The Board functions as the union’s legislative body, approving budgets, policies, and major
      organizational actions while providing a direct link between members and national leadership.
    </p>

    <h3>Committees</h3>
    <p>
      Standing committees are established by internal authority and operate through delegated
      responsibilities. Committees do not possess independent constitutional standing and remain
      subordinate to the Board and national officers.
    </p>

    <h2>Governance Characteristics</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Centralized decision-making authority</li>
      <li>Direct accountability to a single membership body</li>
      <li>Close alignment between governance and contract enforcement</li>
      <li>Clear separation between executive, legislative, and advisory functions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Analytical Significance</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s structure provides a clear reference point for evaluating union governance. By isolating
      authority within a single organization, it allows for direct assessment of accountability,
      responsiveness, and member control without the confounding influence of external federations
      or layered constitutional systems.
