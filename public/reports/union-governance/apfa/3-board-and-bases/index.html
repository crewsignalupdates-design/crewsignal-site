      How APFA structures local representation, scales coverage, and operationalizes member support within a single-carrier union.

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>The Representation Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s representation model is organized around an operational “base layer” that performs day-to-day member service and
      also links directly into national governance. This dual role is central to APFA’s single-carrier design: representation is
      not a separate subsystem — it is the union’s functional interface with members and management.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local representation:</strong> Base leadership and Base Council Representatives (BCRs)</li>
      <li><strong>Coverage scaling:</strong> Regional Representatives and national departments</li>
      <li><strong>Governance linkage:</strong> Base Presidents also sit on the voting Board of Directors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      APFA’s own organizational descriptions emphasize these layers as the core of how the union operates and communicates across the system. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Base Leadership as the Local Authority Layer</h2>
    <p>
      At the base level, APFA identifies Base Presidents and Base Vice Presidents as the primary elected leaders responsible for
      local representation and coordination. APFA’s broader governance design formally couples this local authority into national
      decision-making via the Board of Directors. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Base President:</strong> Local leadership and representational authority; governance linkage to the national Board</li>
      <li><strong>Base Vice President:</strong> Local leadership support and continuity (role execution varies by base practice)</li>
      <li><strong>Operational significance:</strong> Bases are the primary locus of member service and management-facing representation</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Base Council Representatives: The Member-Service Workhorse</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s Base Council Representatives (BCRs) are explicitly described as the “base representative” layer for investigations,
      grievances, and general union operations. They also represent the base membership at conventions and Board of Directors meetings,
      and they maintain communications between base members and APFA. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Investigations and grievances:</strong> Acts as the base representative for investigations and disputes; files Notices of Dispute (NODs / grievances) for individuals, groups, or the base. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
      <li><strong>Representation with management:</strong> Represents members in meetings with management regarding issues such as attendance and performance. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
      <li><strong>Communications role:</strong> Maintains communication between the base membership and APFA. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>
      <li><strong>Convention / governance interface:</strong> Represents the base membership at APFA conventions and Board of Directors meetings. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Representation Scaling: “BCR per 100 Members”</h2>
    <p>
      APFA’s base representation model scales with base size. A base brief discussing a BCR election update states that, under the APFA Constitution,
      each base is allowed one (1) BCR for every 100 members (or fraction thereof), illustrating a proportional staffing logic. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Scaling principle:</strong> BCR allocation grows with membership counts (coverage increases with base size). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</li>
      <li><strong>Service implication:</strong> Larger bases can distribute workload across more elected/assigned reps, reducing single-point overload.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance implication:</strong> Representation density is structured, not ad hoc — it is designed into the model.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Regional Representatives and National Departments</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to base-level representation, APFA describes a layer of Regional Representatives and National Department Chairs as part of its
      organization structure, adding specialized capacity and cross-base coverage. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Regional Representatives:</strong> A coverage layer that can extend representational support beyond a single base footprint. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}</li>
      <li><strong>National Department Chairs:</strong> Subject-matter leadership and coordination for key operational domains (e.g., elections/balloting, scheduling, safety). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}</li>
      <li><strong>Design signal:</strong> Specialized capacity expands through delegation rather than creating a separate constitutional authority center.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Elections, Legitimacy, and Compliance Anchors</h2>
    <p>
      APFA describes its base representative elections as being run by the National Ballot Committee in accordance with governing documents and
      with reference to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). This ties local representative legitimacy to formal procedures
      and external statutory expectations. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Election administration:</strong> National Ballot Committee (NBC) administers elections and publishes procedures and results. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance posture:</strong> Election process references the union’s Constitution/Policy Manual and the LMRDA. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}</li>
      <li><strong>Governance effect:</strong> The member-service layer (bases/BCRs) is designed to be election-legitimated rather than purely appointed.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Member services are structurally embedded:</strong> Representation is delivered primarily through BCRs and base leadership with defined responsibilities. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}</li>
      <li><strong>Scaling is proportional:</strong> BCR allocation tied to membership size supports workload distribution at large bases. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}</li>
      <li><strong>Coverage expands without fragmentation:</strong> Regional reps and departments add capacity while remaining inside the elected governance frame. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimacy is procedural:</strong> The base representative layer is linked to formal election mechanisms and LMRDA expectations. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}</li>
    </ul>
