    <h2>The Legitimacy Model in a Local-First Union</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (IBT),
      member control is anchored primarily at the <em>local union</em> level. Unlike models that rely on
      direct, organization-wide voting for most leadership positions, IBT distributes democratic authority
      across multiple layers through a mix of direct elections and delegate-based processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This structure reflects IBT’s size, geographic dispersion, and strong tradition of local autonomy.
      Member influence is therefore most immediate locally and becomes increasingly mediated at higher
      organizational levels.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Union Elections: Direct Member Control</h2>
    <p>
      The most direct and frequent expression of member control in IBT occurs through
      <strong>Local Union elections</strong>. Members elect their local officers, who exercise substantial
      authority over representation, contract administration, and internal governance.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Direct voting:</strong> Members vote directly for local officers</li>
      <li><strong>Operational authority:</strong> Elected local officers manage day-to-day representation</li>
      <li><strong>Primary accountability:</strong> Members experience governance largely through local leadership</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These elections form the democratic foundation of IBT’s governance system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Delegate Selection and Intermediate Representation</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond the local level, member influence is typically exercised through <strong>delegates</strong>.
      Local Unions elect or appoint delegates to represent them in Joint Councils, conventions, and other
      intermediate or national bodies.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegate mediation:</strong> Member preferences are conveyed upward through local representatives</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregation function:</strong> Delegates balance local interests with regional or national considerations</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced immediacy:</strong> Direct member voting gives way to representative decision-making</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This model prioritizes manageability and coordination over direct, organization-wide plebiscites.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>International Elections and Convention Authority</h2>
    <p>
      At the highest level, IBT leadership selection and constitutional decision-making occur through
      <strong>international conventions</strong> and, in some cases, direct elections for top officers.
      These processes combine delegate authority with broader membership participation where required.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Convention authority:</strong> Delegates exercise formal power over policy and constitutional matters</li>
      <li><strong>National leadership selection:</strong> Top officers may be elected directly or through delegate mechanisms</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional continuity:</strong> Convention cycles provide structured, periodic renewal of authority</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This layered approach reflects IBT’s effort to balance democratic input with organizational stability.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Eligibility, Discipline, and Constitutional Constraints</h2>
    <p>
      Voting rights, candidacy, and office-holding within IBT are governed by constitutional provisions
      related to membership standing, dues compliance, and conduct. These rules operate as both eligibility
      criteria and enforcement mechanisms.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Good standing requirements:</strong> Voting and candidacy depend on dues and membership status</li>
      <li><strong>Office qualifications:</strong> Defined by constitutional and bylaw standards</li>
      <li><strong>Disciplinary authority:</strong> International bodies may suspend or remove officers for cause</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These constraints ensure that democratic processes operate within defined institutional boundaries.
    </p>

    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Strong local democracy:</strong> Member control is most direct at the local union level</li>
      <li><strong>Indirect national influence:</strong> Member preferences are mediated through delegates</li>
      <li><strong>Stability over immediacy:</strong> Delegate systems favor continuity and coordination</li>
      <li><strong>Layered accountability:</strong> Officers answer to different electorates at different levels</li>
