    <h2>The Representation Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong></strong> (IBT),
      representation is designed to be experienced first and foremost at the <em>local union</em> level.
      Unlike more centralized or tightly federated models, IBT places the primary representational burden
      on local unions, with higher bodies providing coordination rather than substitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The representation pipeline therefore emphasizes proximity to the workplace while preserving
      pathways for regional and industry-wide alignment when scale is required.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Unions: Primary Representation and Employer Interface</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Unions</strong> are the core representational units within IBT. They serve as the
      principal interface between members and employers and are responsible for most day-to-day
      representational functions.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership services:</strong> Intake of member issues, grievances, and workplace concerns</li>
      <li><strong>Contract administration:</strong> Enforcement and interpretation of local agreements</li>
      <li><strong>Employer relations:</strong> Direct interaction with management at the local level</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This design gives locals substantial discretion in how representation is delivered, reinforcing
      member identification with the local union as the union.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Joint Councils: Regional Coordination Without Displacement</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Joint Councils</strong> operate as regional coordination bodies composed of multiple Local
      Unions. They are not the primary providers of representation, nor do they typically administer
      contracts directly.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Political coordination:</strong> Aligns endorsements, legislative priorities, and campaigns</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic mediation:</strong> Facilitates resolution of disputes between Local Unions</li>
      <li><strong>Regional alignment:</strong> Supports coordinated action across a geographic area</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Joint Councils add scale and coherence to IBT’s representation model while leaving operational
      authority with the locals.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Industry Divisions and Coordinated Bargaining</h2>
    <p>
      In industries characterized by large employers or national bargaining dynamics, IBT utilizes
      <strong>industry divisions</strong> and coordinated bargaining structures to supplement local action.
      These bodies align strategy across locals representing the same employers or sectors.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Sector expertise:</strong> Develops industry-specific bargaining and enforcement strategies</li>
      <li><strong>Pattern coordination:</strong> Supports national or multi-employer bargaining campaigns</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic leverage:</strong> Amplifies local efforts through collective alignment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Divisions do not replace local unions as bargaining agents; instead, they provide frameworks for
      collective leverage when employer scale demands it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Support and Institutional Backing</h2>
    <p>
      The IBT International provides legal, strategic, and organizational support to subordinate bodies.
      This support enhances representation without centralizing its delivery.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Legal and research support:</strong> Assists with arbitration, litigation, and policy analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Organizing and campaign resources:</strong> Coordinates growth and strategic initiatives</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional continuity:</strong> Preserves precedent and union-wide standards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      National support functions act as force multipliers rather than substitutes for local representation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Division of Representational Labor</h2>
    <p>
      IBT’s representation model deliberately separates functions across organizational levels:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local Unions:</strong> Member interface, contract administration, employer relations</li>
      <li><strong>Joint Councils:</strong> Regional coordination and political alignment</li>
      <li><strong>Divisions:</strong> Industry-wide strategy and coordinated bargaining</li>
      <li><strong>International Union:</strong> Oversight, resources, and constitutional enforcement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This separation preserves local autonomy while enabling coordinated action when necessary.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>High local visibility:</strong> Members experience representation primarily through their local union</li>
      <li><strong>Flexible scaling:</strong> Coordination can occur by region or by industry</li>
      <li><strong>Uneven experience risk:</strong> Quality of representation may vary across locals</li>
      <li><strong>Strong identity formation:</strong> Local autonomy reinforces member identification and engagement</li>
    </ul>
