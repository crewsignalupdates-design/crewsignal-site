    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT)</strong> is a large, multi-industry labor organization
      representing members across transportation, logistics, warehousing, public sector, construction, and related
      industries. Unlike a single-carrier union (APFA) or a tightly federated lodge model (IAM), IBT is structurally
      defined by <strong>strong local union autonomy</strong> coordinated through intermediate bodies and an international
      (national) center.
    </p>
    <p>
      IBT’s governance model is designed to manage scale without collapsing decision-making into a single national
      operating unit. Many representational functions are anchored at the <em>local union</em> level, with coordination
      and policy coherence supplied by joint councils, divisions, and the international union.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Origins and Scope</h2>
    <p>
      IBT’s growth and institutional identity are rooted in transportation and logistics—industries where bargaining
      structures often require local responsiveness, regional coordination, and the capacity to negotiate with large
      employers. Over time, IBT expanded into many sectors, producing a governance design that prioritizes:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local control</strong> over membership interface and internal operations</li>
      <li><strong>Regional coordination</strong> across locals when bargaining or politics require scale</li>
      <li><strong>National coherence</strong> through constitutional authority and international leadership</li>
      <li><strong>Industry specialization</strong> via divisions and councils aligned to major sectors</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Decentralized Union Model</h2>
    <p>
      IBT is best understood as a <strong>decentralized federated system</strong>. Its power is distributed across
      multiple institutional layers that serve different purposes:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local Unions:</strong> Primary membership home, local governance, day-to-day representation</li>
      <li><strong>Joint Councils:</strong> Regional coordination bodies linking multiple locals (often political and strategic alignment)</li>
      <li><strong>Divisions / Industry Structures:</strong> Specialized coordination and bargaining alignment across major sectors</li>
      <li><strong>International Union:</strong> Constitutional authority, chartering/oversight functions, and union-wide policy direction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This design allows IBT to maintain a unified identity and shared resources while preserving meaningful autonomy
      for local unions that operate closest to the workplace.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Core Governance Principle</h2>
    <p>
      IBT’s structure reflects a central principle: <em>local autonomy with coordinated power</em>.
      Local unions retain substantial operational authority, while intermediate and national bodies provide
      coordination, policy standards, and mechanisms for union-wide action when required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practically, this means IBT governance often separates:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Member interface</strong> (local unions)</li>
      <li><strong>Regional/political coordination</strong> (joint councils)</li>
      <li><strong>Industry-wide leverage</strong> (divisions and coordinated bargaining structures)</li>
      <li><strong>Constitutional oversight and continuity</strong> (international union)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Characteristics</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Strong local identity:</strong> Locals function as the primary unit of representation and governance</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple coordination layers:</strong> Joint councils and divisions enable scale without eliminating local power</li>
      <li><strong>Industry diversity:</strong> Governance must accommodate different contract architectures across sectors</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable coalition design:</strong> The structure supports broad membership growth while keeping bargaining adaptable</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Analytical Significance</h2>
    <p>
      IBT provides a clear case study in decentralized union governance at scale. Its architecture highlights a distinct
      trade-off: greater local autonomy and adaptability, paired with more complex pathways for national alignment and
      accountability. This series will examine how IBT resolves that tension through authority routing, election design,
      administrative systems, and financial governance.
