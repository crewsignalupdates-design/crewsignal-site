    <h2>Why Committees Are Central in the IBT Model</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (IBT),
      contract administration is not centralized in a single national office. Instead, enforcement and
      interpretation are carried out primarily by <em>Local Unions</em>, supported by committees and
      coordinated structures that operate at regional, industry, and international levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Committees therefore function as the operational backbone of IBT’s governance system, translating
      negotiated agreements into day-to-day practice while preserving local autonomy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Committees: Workplace-Level Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Union committees</strong> are responsible for the first line of contract administration.
      These committees monitor compliance, receive member complaints, and initiate grievance procedures
      under applicable collective bargaining agreements.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Shop and grievance committees:</strong> Address day-to-day violations and interpret local agreements</li>
      <li><strong>Member intake:</strong> Collect and document complaints from the workplace</li>
      <li><strong>Employer interface:</strong> Engage directly with local management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structure ensures that enforcement remains closely connected to workplace conditions and
      member experience.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Coordinated Bargaining Committees</h2>
    <p>
      In industries characterized by large employers or multi-employer bargaining, IBT relies on
      <strong>coordinated bargaining committees</strong>. These bodies align strategy across multiple
      locals while allowing each local to retain its formal bargaining authority.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Pattern development:</strong> Establishes common proposals and bargaining goals</li>
      <li><strong>Information sharing:</strong> Coordinates data, leverage points, and timelines</li>
      <li><strong>Collective leverage:</strong> Amplifies local bargaining power through alignment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Coordinated committees enhance bargaining effectiveness without collapsing negotiations into
      a single national bargaining unit.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Grievance Handling and Arbitration</h2>
    <p>
      IBT contracts typically include structured grievance and arbitration procedures. While grievances
      are initiated locally, their progression often involves coordination and support beyond the local level.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local initiation:</strong> Grievances begin at the workplace or local union level</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic review:</strong> More complex cases may be reviewed by regional or industry bodies</li>
      <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> Escalated disputes proceed to arbitration with broader union support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This layered approach balances immediacy with consistency and cost control.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Joint Councils and Inter-Local Coordination</h2>
    <p>
      While Joint Councils do not typically administer contracts directly, they play a supporting role
      in contract administration by facilitating coordination among locals and mediating disputes that
      span multiple jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Conflict mediation:</strong> Helps resolve inter-local disputes</li>
      <li><strong>Policy alignment:</strong> Encourages consistent approaches within a region</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic support:</strong> Assists with large-scale campaigns and actions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Joint Councils add coherence without displacing local enforcement authority.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>International Support and Oversight</h2>
    <p>
      The IBT International provides legal, research, and strategic support to subordinate bodies.
      These resources enhance enforcement capacity while preserving the decentralized character of
      contract administration.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Legal support:</strong> Assists with arbitration, litigation, and precedent management</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic coordination:</strong> Aligns campaigns across employers and regions</li>
      <li><strong>Constitutional oversight:</strong> Ensures committees operate within union rules</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Delegation, Autonomy, and Control</h2>
    <p>
      IBT’s committee system reflects a deliberate balance between delegated authority and institutional control.
      Committees are empowered to act within defined scopes, while higher bodies retain the ability to intervene
      when actions threaten union-wide coherence or compliance.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegated:</strong> Day-to-day enforcement and bargaining execution</li>
      <li><strong>Coordinated:</strong> Strategy alignment across locals and industries</li>
      <li><strong>Constrained:</strong> Constitutional limits and international oversight</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Strong local enforcement:</strong> Members experience contract administration primarily through their local</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable coordination:</strong> Committees enable alignment without centralization</li>
      <li><strong>Variable outcomes:</strong> Local autonomy can produce uneven enforcement quality</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional backstop:</strong> International resources preserve precedent and leverage</li>
    </ul>
