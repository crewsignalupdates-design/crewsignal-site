      How power originates locally, is coordinated regionally and by industry, and is constrained by international authority.

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>The Authority Problem IBT Is Designed to Solve</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (IBT)
      represents members across many industries and employers where workplace conditions, bargaining structures,
      and political environments vary significantly by location. Its governance system is therefore designed to
      preserve <em>local decision-making power</em> while still enabling coordinated action at regional and national scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Authority in IBT does not terminate at a single center. Instead, it flows through multiple, purpose-built
      axes that balance autonomy with coordination.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 1: Membership → Local Unions</h2>
    <p>
      Authority in IBT originates with the membership and is first exercised through the <strong>Local Union</strong>.
      Local Unions are the primary units of governance, representation, and identity within the IBT structure.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership home:</strong> Members belong directly to a Local Union</li>
      <li><strong>Local governance:</strong> Locals elect officers, manage internal affairs, and interface with employers</li>
      <li><strong>Operational authority:</strong> Locals typically administer contracts and handle grievances</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Compared to other union models, IBT locals retain a comparatively high degree of operational autonomy,
      particularly in employer relations and internal governance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 2: Local Unions → Joint Councils</h2>
    <p>
      Above the local level, <strong>Joint Councils</strong> serve as regional coordination bodies composed of
      multiple Local Unions. They do not typically bargain contracts, but play a significant role in political,
      strategic, and organizational alignment.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Regional aggregation:</strong> Links locals within a geographic area</li>
      <li><strong>Political coordination:</strong> Aligns endorsements, legislative activity, and campaigns</li>
      <li><strong>Dispute mediation:</strong> May facilitate resolution of inter-local conflicts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Joint Councils provide scale and coordination without displacing the core authority of Local Unions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 3: Industry Divisions and Coordinated Structures</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to geographic coordination, IBT operates through <strong>industry-based divisions</strong>
      and coordinated bargaining structures. These bodies align strategy across major sectors such as freight,
      parcel, airline, and public sector work.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Industry specialization:</strong> Tailors strategy to sector-specific bargaining realities</li>
      <li><strong>Coordinated leverage:</strong> Enables pattern bargaining and national campaigns</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic alignment:</strong> Supports consistency across locals representing the same employers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Divisions supplement, rather than replace, local bargaining authority by providing frameworks for
      collective action at scale.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 4: International Union Authority</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>International Union</strong> functions as the constitutional and supervisory authority
      within IBT. Its role is not to manage day-to-day representation, but to maintain organizational integrity,
      enforce constitutional rules, and coordinate union-wide initiatives.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Constitutional primacy:</strong> Final authority over interpretation and enforcement of union rules</li>
      <li><strong>Chartering and oversight:</strong> Authority to charter, merge, or discipline subordinate bodies</li>
      <li><strong>Union-wide strategy:</strong> Coordinates national bargaining, organizing, and political priorities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      International authority acts as a backstop rather than a replacement for local power.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 5: Delegation, Autonomy, and Constraint</h2>
    <p>
      A defining feature of IBT’s authority model is the deliberate tension between <em>delegated autonomy</em>
      and <em>constitutional constraint</em>. Local Unions are empowered to act, but within a framework that
      permits coordination and intervention when necessary.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegated:</strong> Employer relations, contract administration, member services</li>
      <li><strong>Coordinated:</strong> Regional politics, industry campaigns, strategic bargaining</li>
      <li><strong>Constrained:</strong> Constitutional compliance, discipline, and union-wide standards</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Strong local power:</strong> Locals serve as the primary decision-makers</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple coordination paths:</strong> Authority can flow geographically or by industry</li>
      <li><strong>Decentralized accountability:</strong> Members experience governance primarily at the local level</li>
      <li><strong>Centralized safeguards:</strong> International authority preserves institutional cohesion</li>
    </ul>
