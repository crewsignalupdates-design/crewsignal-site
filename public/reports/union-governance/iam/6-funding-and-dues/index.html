    <h2>Why Financial Governance Is Structurally Central</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (IAM),
      financial governance is inseparable from organizational authority. Because IAM operates through multiple
      layers—Local Lodges, District Lodges, and a national governing body—money must move predictably across
      those layers without undermining constitutional control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The financial system therefore mirrors the governance system: <em>delegated spending authority under
      centralized oversight</em>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Dues as the Primary Revenue Source</h2>
    <p>
      IAM’s principal source of revenue is member dues. Dues are assessed on members affiliated through
      Local Lodges and are distributed upward according to constitutionally defined formulas.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership-funded:</strong> Union operations are financed primarily by dues, not external subsidies</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-level distribution:</strong> Dues flow from members to locals, districts, and the national level</li>
      <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Standardized assessments support budgeting across the organization</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local and District Financial Authority</h2>
    <p>
      Local and District Lodges exercise operational control over their allocated funds. These bodies
      finance local administration, representation, bargaining, and member services within their
      jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local Lodges:</strong> Fund internal governance, communications, and member engagement</li>
      <li><strong>District Lodges:</strong> Finance negotiations, grievance handling, arbitration, and enforcement</li>
      <li><strong>Budget responsibility:</strong> Subordinate bodies are expected to manage funds prudently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This decentralized spending authority allows IAM to respond to diverse employer and industry conditions
      without requiring national approval for routine expenditures.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Financial Oversight</h2>
    <p>
      While spending authority is distributed, financial control is ultimately centralized. The national
      organization retains oversight powers to ensure constitutional compliance, fiscal integrity, and
      organizational solvency.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Constitutional supervision:</strong> National rules govern dues rates, distributions, and reporting</li>
      <li><strong>Audit and review:</strong> Subordinate bodies are subject to review and corrective action</li>
      <li><strong>Intervention authority:</strong> National leadership may intervene in cases of mismanagement</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Strike Funds, Reserves, and Risk Management</h2>
    <p>
      As a multi-industry union, IAM must maintain financial reserves capable of supporting prolonged labor
      disputes across different sectors. Strike funds and reserves therefore function as strategic assets,
      not merely accounting entries.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Collective risk pooling:</strong> Reserves spread risk across the full membership base</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining leverage:</strong> Financial preparedness strengthens negotiating position</li>
      <li><strong>Continuity planning:</strong> Reserves protect core operations during disruptions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Transparency and Internal Accountability</h2>
    <p>
      Financial accountability within IAM is enforced through a combination of elected financial officers,
      reporting requirements, and internal oversight mechanisms. These systems substitute for the direct,
      member-wide financial visibility found in smaller or single-carrier unions.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Elected stewardship:</strong> Financial officers are accountable to the membership indirectly</li>
      <li><strong>Structured reporting:</strong> Regular financial reports support internal review</li>
      <li><strong>Disciplinary backstop:</strong> Mismanagement can trigger national intervention</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Scale enables stability:</strong> Large membership base supports pooled reserves</li>
      <li><strong>Decentralized spending:</strong> Locals and districts retain operational flexibility</li>
      <li><strong>Centralized control:</strong> National oversight protects institutional integrity</li>
      <li><strong>Complex accountability:</strong> Financial transparency is layered rather than direct</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Transition Point</h2>
    <p>
      This report concludes the IAM internal governance series. While it explains how IAM manages money
      internally, a separate analytical framework governs how labor organizations disclose finances
      externally under federal law. That framework—LM-2, LM-3, and LM-4 reporting—will be addressed as a
      cross-union reference applicable to all governance models examined in this series.
