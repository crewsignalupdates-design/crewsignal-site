    <h2>Financial Governance</h2>
    <p>
      In a multi-industry labor organization, financial governance operates across multiple layers of authority rather than a single carrier or craft. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers must allocate resources across diverse industries, bargaining units, and representational priorities while maintaining centralized oversight and compliance. As a result, dues structure, budget authority, and financial controls are not only mechanisms of operational support, but also instruments for balancing autonomy, scale, and accountability across the union’s federated structure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Dues Structure and Revenue Source</h2>
    <p>
      International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers’s primary revenue source is membership dues collected from flight attendants.
      Dues levels and collection mechanisms are governed internally, linking member participation directly
      to the union’s operating capacity.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Primary funding source:</strong> Member dues.</li>
      <li><strong>Carrier scope:</strong> Revenue base is limited to a single employer’s workforce.</li>
      <li><strong>Governance implication:</strong> Budget stability depends on membership size, retention, and compliance.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Budget Authority and Approval</h2>
    <p>
      Financial authority in International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers follows the same centralized governance logic as policy authority.
      Budgets are prepared through executive processes but require approval by the union’s governing body,
      tying spending authority to elected leadership rather than staff discretion.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Executive officers develop proposed budgets.</li>
      <li><strong>Approval:</strong> Governing board approval anchors financial decisions in representative authority.</li>
      <li><strong>Control signal:</strong> Major expenditures are not unilateral executive actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Expenditures and Operational Spend</h2>
    <p>
      International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers’s expenditures reflect the operational demands of contract negotiation, enforcement, elections,
      member services, and safety oversight. Spending priorities therefore mirror the union’s governance
      commitments rather than diversified external programs.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Negotiations:</strong> Bargaining support, research, and communications.</li>
      <li><strong>Contract administration:</strong> Scheduling support, grievances, arbitration, and compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Elections:</strong> Balloting services and election administration.</li>
      <li><strong>Member services:</strong> Base-level representation and departmental operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Strike and Reserve Funds</h2>
    <p>
      International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers must internally provision for labor actions and financial contingencies.
      Strike and reserve funds are therefore a critical component of financial governance rather than an
      auxiliary feature.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Risk containment:</strong> Reserves protect operational continuity during labor disputes.</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining leverage:</strong> Financial preparedness strengthens negotiating posture.</li>
      <li><strong>Member trust factor:</strong> Adequate reserves signal institutional durability.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2>Internal Controls and Accountability</h2>
  <p>
    Financial accountability within the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers
    is maintained through layered controls that operate across the union’s national, district, and
    bargaining-unit structures. Oversight mechanisms are designed to balance centralized financial
    stewardship with delegated operational authority, ensuring consistency, compliance, and fiscal
    discipline across diverse industries and units.
  </p>
  <ul class="cs-report__list">
    <li>
      <strong>National financial officers:</strong> Centralized officers oversee accounting standards,
      reporting compliance, and consolidated financial management.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Governing body oversight:</strong> Executive boards and constitutional bodies review budgets,
      expenditures, and financial policies at multiple organizational levels.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unit-level accountability:</strong> Subordinate bodies remain responsible for local compliance
      within the parameters set by national financial controls.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Reporting and audit mechanisms:</strong> Regular internal reporting and statutory disclosures
      provide transparency and enable cross-unit financial monitoring.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
  <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
  <p>
    Financial governance within the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers
    reflects the requirements of a large, multi-industry labor organization rather than a single-carrier
    union. Resource allocation, reserve management, and financial oversight operate across multiple
    bargaining units and industries, requiring centralized controls alongside delegated authority.
    This structure emphasizes scale, institutional continuity, and cross-sector risk management,
    while necessarily constraining the degree to which any single craft or carrier group can
    independently direct financial priorities.
