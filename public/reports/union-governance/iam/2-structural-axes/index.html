    <h2>The Authority Problem IAM Is Designed to Solve</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong></strong> (IAM)
      operates across hundreds of employers, industries, and bargaining units. Its governance architecture
      is therefore designed to solve a core problem: how to preserve local responsiveness while maintaining
      national coherence, discipline, and constitutional control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is a system of <em>layered authority</em>, where power flows through defined organizational
      axes rather than residing in a single governing body.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 1: Membership → Local Lodges</h2>
    <p>
      Authority in IAM begins with the membership and is first expressed at the <strong>Local Lodge</strong> level.
      Local Lodges serve as the primary interface between members and the union, handling internal governance,
      member services, and certain representational functions.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership base:</strong> Members are affiliated through a Local Lodge</li>
      <li><strong>Local governance:</strong> Local officers administer lodge affairs and internal operations</li>
      <li><strong>Limited autonomy:</strong> Local authority exists only within the bounds of the IAM Constitution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While Local Lodges provide the union’s most direct member contact, they are not independent labor
      organizations. Their authority is chartered, supervised, and revocable by the national body.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 2: Local Lodges → District Lodges</h2>
    <p>
      Above the Local Lodges sit the <strong>District Lodges</strong>, which function as multi-local
      coordinating bodies. In many industries, District Lodges are the primary bargaining agents,
      conducting negotiations and administering collective bargaining agreements on behalf of
      multiple Local Lodges.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Aggregation function:</strong> Combines multiple Local Lodges under a single district structure</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining authority:</strong> Often holds responsibility for contract negotiation and enforcement</li>
      <li><strong>Operational scale:</strong> Enables consistent bargaining across employers or regions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      District Lodges thus represent a critical middle layer: they exercise substantial operational
      authority, yet remain subject to oversight and constraint from the national level.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 3: District Lodges → Grand Lodge</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Grand Lodge</strong> constitutes IAM’s national governing authority. It is responsible
      for constitutional interpretation, issuance and revocation of charters, supervision of subordinate
      bodies, and the maintenance of union-wide policy and discipline.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Constitutional primacy:</strong> Final authority over interpretation and enforcement of the IAM Constitution</li>
      <li><strong>Chartering power:</strong> Authority to create, merge, suspend, or dissolve subordinate bodies</li>
      <li><strong>Oversight function:</strong> Supervises districts and locals to ensure compliance and uniformity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unlike Local and District Lodges, the Grand Lodge does not bargain with employers directly in most
      cases. Its power is supervisory and structural rather than operational.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 4: Delegation vs. Control</h2>
    <p>
      A defining feature of IAM’s authority model is the distinction between <em>delegated authority</em>
      and <em>retained control</em>. Operational responsibilities are pushed downward to Districts and Locals,
      while constitutional and disciplinary authority remains centralized.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegated:</strong> Day-to-day representation, bargaining, grievance handling</li>
      <li><strong>Retained:</strong> Constitutional interpretation, charter authority, financial supervision</li>
      <li><strong>Constraint mechanism:</strong> National authority can intervene when subordinate bodies exceed scope</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Layered accountability:</strong> Members are represented locally, bargained for at the district level, and governed nationally</li>
      <li><strong>Operational scale:</strong> IAM can negotiate across multiple employers without fragmenting into independent unions</li>
      <li><strong>Complex authority paths:</strong> Decision-making is distributed, not singular</li>
      <li><strong>Centralized backstop:</strong> National authority serves as a corrective mechanism</li>
    </ul>
