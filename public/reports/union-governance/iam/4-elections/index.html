    <h2>The Legitimacy Challenge in a Federated Union</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (IAM),
      elections serve a different function than in single-carrier unions. Because authority is layered across
      Local Lodges, District Lodges, and the national organization, legitimacy is produced through a
      combination of direct elections, delegate-based conventions, and constitutional eligibility rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Member control therefore operates indirectly as well as directly: members elect local officers and
      delegates, who in turn participate in higher-level decision-making.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Lodge Elections: Direct Member Control</h2>
    <p>
      The most direct expression of member control in IAM occurs at the <strong>Local Lodge</strong> level.
      Members elect local officers who manage lodge affairs, represent members internally, and serve as the
      conduit between the membership and higher organizational layers.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Direct voting:</strong> Members vote directly for Local Lodge officers</li>
      <li><strong>Governance scope:</strong> Local officers administer internal lodge operations</li>
      <li><strong>Pipeline function:</strong> Local elections populate the delegate pool for higher bodies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These elections anchor IAM’s democratic legitimacy at the point closest to the membership.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>District Lodge Elections and Representation</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>District Lodges</strong> occupy an intermediate position between locals and the national
      organization. District officers are typically elected by delegates from affiliated Local Lodges,
      rather than by the full membership directly.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegate-based elections:</strong> District officers are chosen by representatives from Local Lodges</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining authority:</strong> Elected district leadership often directs negotiations and contract administration</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregation effect:</strong> Member preferences are filtered through local representation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structure prioritizes coordinated bargaining and operational coherence over direct,
      organization-wide voting at every level.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Elections and the Role of Conventions</h2>
    <p>
      IAM’s national leadership is selected primarily through <strong>convention-based processes</strong>.
      Delegates elected or appointed from subordinate bodies convene to elect top officers, amend the
      constitution, and set union-wide policy.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Convention authority:</strong> Supreme governing body for elections and constitutional change</li>
      <li><strong>Indirect member control:</strong> Members influence outcomes through delegate selection</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional continuity:</strong> Conventions balance democratic input with organizational stability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This model reflects IAM’s size and scope, trading immediacy of direct voting for manageability and
      representational scale.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Eligibility, Discipline, and Constitutional Constraints</h2>
    <p>
      Eligibility to vote or hold office in IAM is governed by constitutional requirements related to
      membership status, dues standing, and conduct. These rules function as both administrative controls
      and mechanisms for enforcing organizational discipline.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership in good standing:</strong> Required for voting and candidacy</li>
      <li><strong>Office qualifications:</strong> Defined by constitutional and bylaw provisions</li>
      <li><strong>Disciplinary authority:</strong> National oversight can suspend or remove officers for cause</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These constraints ensure that electoral legitimacy operates within defined institutional boundaries.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Indirect democracy:</strong> Member influence is strongest at the local level and mediated upward</li>
      <li><strong>Stability over immediacy:</strong> Convention-based elections favor continuity in leadership</li>
      <li><strong>Layered accountability:</strong> Officers answer to different constituencies at different levels</li>
      <li><strong>Constitutional primacy:</strong> Electoral outcomes are bounded by national rules and oversight</li>
    </ul>
