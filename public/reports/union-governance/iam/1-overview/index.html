    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (IAM)
      is a large, federated labor organization representing workers across multiple industries, employers,
      and geographic regions. Unlike single-carrier or single-industry unions, IAM’s governance system is
      designed to scale representation across diverse bargaining units while maintaining centralized
      constitutional authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      IAM’s structure reflects its core challenge: coordinating local autonomy, district-level bargaining,
      and national oversight within a single constitutional framework. Authority is therefore layered,
      delegated, and formally constrained by organizational rules rather than concentrated in a single
      bargaining entity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Historical Context and Scope</h2>
    <p>
      IAM originated as a craft-based organization and expanded over time into a broad, multi-industry union.
      Its modern membership spans aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, defense, and related sectors,
      often representing workers at multiple employers simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      This expansion necessitated a governance model capable of:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Supporting bargaining across distinct employers and industries</li>
      <li>Maintaining internal consistency through a single constitution</li>
      <li>Delegating authority to regional and functional sub-units</li>
      <li>Preserving national oversight and financial control</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Federated Union Model</h2>
    <p>
      IAM operates as a <strong>federated union</strong>. Representation is delivered through a hierarchy of
      organizational units, each with defined responsibilities and limits:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local Lodges:</strong> Primary member interface and local governance</li>
      <li><strong>District Lodges:</strong> Multi-local bodies that often conduct bargaining and contract administration</li>
      <li><strong>Grand Lodge:</strong> The national governing authority responsible for constitutional interpretation,
          charters, oversight, and union-wide policy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This model allows IAM to represent workers across hundreds of employers while retaining a unified
      institutional identity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Core Governance Principle</h2>
    <p>
      IAM’s governance framework is built around a central principle: <em>delegated authority under
      constitutional constraint</em>. Local and district bodies exercise meaningful operational power,
      but do so within boundaries set by the IAM Constitution and overseen by national leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>No single local or district functions as a fully autonomous union</li>
      <li>National authority retains the power to charter, supervise, and discipline subordinate bodies</li>
      <li>Policy uniformity is prioritized over employer-specific independence</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Characteristics</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Multi-employer scope:</strong> IAM represents members at many employers simultaneously</li>
      <li><strong>Layered authority:</strong> Governance is distributed across local, district, and national levels</li>
      <li><strong>Constitutional primacy:</strong> All sub-units derive authority from the national constitution</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable design:</strong> The model accommodates growth, mergers, and sectoral expansion</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Analytical Significance</h2>
    <p>
      IAM provides a clear example of a mature, federated labor organization operating at scale.
      Its structure highlights the trade-offs inherent in multi-industry unionism:
      flexibility and reach on one hand, and increased complexity and layered accountability on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In subsequent reports, this series will examine how IAM’s authority flows in practice, how
      representation is delivered, and how elections, committees, and finances function within this
      federated system.
