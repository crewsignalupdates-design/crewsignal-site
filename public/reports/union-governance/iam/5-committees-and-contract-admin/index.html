  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Why Committees Matter in a Federated System</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (IAM),
      contract administration cannot be centralized in a single office. The union represents workers across
      many employers, industries, and regions, each governed by distinct agreements and operational realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Committees therefore function as the union’s primary mechanism for distributing subject-matter expertise,
      enforcing agreements, and coordinating action across organizational layers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>District Lodges as the Administrative Core</h2>
    <p>
      While IAM maintains national oversight, <strong>District Lodges</strong> typically serve as the
      operational center for contract administration. District leadership oversees negotiations,
      grievance handling, and day-to-day enforcement for the bargaining units under its jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Negotiations:</strong> District officers and committees conduct collective bargaining</li>
      <li><strong>Contract enforcement:</strong> Districts manage interpretation and compliance</li>
      <li><strong>Dispute escalation:</strong> Grievances are processed through district-controlled systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structure allows IAM to tailor enforcement to employer-specific contracts while maintaining
      organizational coherence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Committees and Workplace-Level Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
      At the workplace level, <strong>Local Lodges</strong> support contract administration through
      elected or appointed committee members. These committees monitor compliance, identify violations,
      and serve as the first point of escalation for member concerns.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Shop committees:</strong> Address day-to-day issues and interpret local contract provisions</li>
      <li><strong>Member intake:</strong> Receive complaints and document potential violations</li>
      <li><strong>Coordination role:</strong> Interface with district representatives on unresolved matters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Local committees provide immediacy and situational awareness, but they operate within the
      enforcement framework established by the District Lodge.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Grievance and Arbitration Systems</h2>
    <p>
      IAM’s contract administration model relies on structured grievance procedures embedded in
      collective bargaining agreements. These procedures define how disputes are raised, reviewed,
      and escalated.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Grievance processing:</strong> Typically initiated at the local level</li>
      <li><strong>District oversight:</strong> District leadership evaluates merits and strategy</li>
      <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> Higher-level disputes may proceed to arbitration with district or national support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Arbitration strategy is often coordinated at the district or national level to ensure
      consistency, cost control, and precedent management.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Committees and Specialized Oversight</h2>
    <p>
      IAM maintains national committees and departments that provide expertise across the organization.
      These bodies do not replace district authority, but offer guidance, training, and institutional memory.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Legal and research committees:</strong> Support arbitration and litigation strategy</li>
      <li><strong>Safety and training bodies:</strong> Address industry-specific regulatory and safety issues</li>
      <li><strong>Policy coordination:</strong> Promote consistency across districts and industries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      National committees act as force multipliers, enabling districts to leverage shared resources
      without surrendering operational control.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Delegation, Oversight, and Control</h2>
    <p>
      A defining feature of IAM’s committee system is the balance between delegation and oversight.
      Committees are empowered to act within defined scopes, but remain subject to district and national review.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegated authority:</strong> Committees execute bargaining and enforcement tasks</li>
      <li><strong>Oversight mechanisms:</strong> District and national bodies review outcomes and compliance</li>
      <li><strong>Corrective power:</strong> Higher levels can intervene if committees exceed authority</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Distributed enforcement:</strong> Contract administration scales across employers and regions</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced fragmentation:</strong> District coordination limits inconsistent local outcomes</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional continuity:</strong> National committees preserve expertise and precedent</li>
      <li><strong>Complex workflows:</strong> Multiple layers increase procedural rigor but add complexity</li>
    </ul>
