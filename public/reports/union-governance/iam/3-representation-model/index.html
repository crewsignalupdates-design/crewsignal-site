    <h2>The Representation Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (IAM),
      representation is delivered through a multi-layered pipeline designed to balance proximity to members
      with the scale required for multi-employer bargaining. Unlike single-carrier unions, IAM separates
      <em>member contact</em>, <em>bargaining authority</em>, and <em>constitutional oversight</em> across
      distinct organizational levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      This design reflects the practical reality of IAM’s scope: representation must function across
      different employers, industries, and geographic regions without fragmenting into independent locals.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Lodges: Member Interface and Internal Governance</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Lodges</strong> form the foundation of IAM’s representation model. They serve as the
      primary point of contact for members, administering internal governance, local communications,
      and certain representational activities.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership affiliation:</strong> Members belong to a Local Lodge</li>
      <li><strong>Internal governance:</strong> Local officers manage lodge affairs and member engagement</li>
      <li><strong>Proximity advantage:</strong> Locals maintain direct awareness of workplace conditions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While Local Lodges are closest to members, their representational authority is limited. They do not
      typically conduct independent bargaining and remain subject to district and national direction.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>District Lodges: Bargaining and Contract Administration</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>District Lodges</strong> are the operational core of IAM’s representation system. In many
      sectors, District Lodges are designated as the bargaining agents responsible for negotiating,
      administering, and enforcing collective bargaining agreements.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Multi-local coordination:</strong> Aggregates multiple Local Lodges under a single bargaining entity</li>
      <li><strong>Negotiation authority:</strong> Conducts bargaining with employers on behalf of members</li>
      <li><strong>Contract administration:</strong> Oversees grievances, enforcement, and interpretation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structure allows IAM to present a unified bargaining posture across large employers or regions,
      avoiding fragmentation while preserving local input through the lodge system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Support Structures</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond Locals and Districts, IAM maintains national departments and staff functions that provide
      specialized support. These units do not replace local or district representation, but augment it
      with expertise and continuity.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Legal and research support:</strong> Assists districts with arbitration, litigation, and policy analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Organizing and strategic coordination:</strong> Supports growth, mergers, and cross-sector initiatives</li>
      <li><strong>Training and education:</strong> Develops leadership capacity within subordinate bodies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      National support structures reinforce consistency across the organization without displacing
      district-level operational authority.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Division of Representational Labor</h2>
    <p>
      IAM’s representation model deliberately separates functions across levels to manage scale and
      complexity:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local Lodges:</strong> Member engagement, internal governance, local issue identification</li>
      <li><strong>District Lodges:</strong> Bargaining, grievance handling, and contract enforcement</li>
      <li><strong>National level:</strong> Oversight, expertise, and institutional continuity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This division minimizes duplication while ensuring that no single layer must perform every
      representational function.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Scalable representation:</strong> IAM can represent members across many employers without creating separate unions</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced local autonomy:</strong> Locals trade independence for bargaining scale and institutional backing</li>
      <li><strong>Operational resilience:</strong> Expertise and continuity are retained at the national level</li>
      <li><strong>Complex accountability paths:</strong> Members interact locally, but outcomes are often determined at the district level</li>
    </ul>
