    <h2>The Legitimacy Model in a National–Divisional Union</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong></strong> (TWU),
      member control is exercised through a combination of direct local elections and representative,
      delegate-based decision-making at higher organizational levels. This structure reflects TWU’s
      emphasis on national coherence and industry-specific execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Democratic authority is therefore strongest at the local level and becomes increasingly mediated
      through divisions and national bodies as decisions move upward.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Union Elections: Direct Member Control</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Union elections</strong> are the most direct mechanism of member control within TWU.
      Members elect local officers who administer internal affairs, represent members at the workplace,
      and implement divisional and national policy.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Direct voting:</strong> Members vote directly for local officers</li>
      <li><strong>Operational authority:</strong> Local officers manage day-to-day representation</li>
      <li><strong>Primary accountability:</strong> Members experience governance most directly through locals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These elections form the democratic foundation of TWU’s governance system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Divisional Representation and Delegate Selection</h2>
    <p>
      Above the local level, TWU relies on <strong>divisional structures</strong> to aggregate member
      preferences and coordinate industry-specific governance. Locals select representatives or delegates
      to participate in divisional councils, conventions, and committees.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegate mediation:</strong> Member preferences are conveyed upward through local representatives</li>
      <li><strong>Industry alignment:</strong> Divisions balance local interests with sector-wide priorities</li>
      <li><strong>Policy shaping:</strong> Divisional bodies influence bargaining strategy and standards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This system prioritizes coordinated execution across industries while preserving local electoral legitimacy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Elections and Convention Authority</h2>
    <p>
      TWU’s national leadership and constitutional decisions are determined primarily through
      <strong>national conventions</strong>. Delegates from locals and divisions convene to elect
      top officers, amend governing documents, and set union-wide policy.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Convention authority:</strong> Supreme decision-making body for elections and constitutional change</li>
      <li><strong>Indirect member control:</strong> Members influence outcomes through delegate selection</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional continuity:</strong> Convention cycles provide structured renewal of authority</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This model reflects TWU’s scale and sectoral diversity, favoring coordinated governance over
      organization-wide plebiscites.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Eligibility, Discipline, and Constitutional Constraints</h2>
    <p>
      Voting rights, candidacy, and office-holding within TWU are governed by constitutional provisions
      related to membership standing, dues compliance, and conduct. These requirements operate as both
      eligibility criteria and enforcement mechanisms.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Good standing requirements:</strong> Voting and candidacy depend on dues and membership status</li>
      <li><strong>Office qualifications:</strong> Defined by constitutional and bylaw standards</li>
      <li><strong>Disciplinary authority:</strong> National bodies may suspend or remove officers for cause</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These constraints ensure that democratic processes operate within defined institutional boundaries.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Strong local legitimacy:</strong> Member control is most direct at the local level</li>
      <li><strong>Delegated national governance:</strong> Higher-level decisions are mediated through divisions and conventions</li>
      <li><strong>Stability over immediacy:</strong> Convention-based systems favor continuity and coordination</li>
      <li><strong>Clear authority paths:</strong> Electoral outcomes are bounded by national constitutional rules</li>
    </ul>
