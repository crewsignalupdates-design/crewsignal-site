    <h2>Why Committees Matter in the TWU Model</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong></strong> (TWU),
      contract administration is structured to balance centralized policy with industry-specific execution.
      Committees are the primary instruments through which negotiated agreements are interpreted, enforced,
      and escalated across local, divisional, and national levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike decentralized local-autonomy models, TWU relies on committees to ensure consistency across
      sectors while preserving operational responsiveness at the workplace.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Committees: Workplace-Level Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Union committees</strong> form the first line of contract administration. These committees
      monitor compliance, receive member complaints, and initiate grievance procedures under applicable
      collective bargaining agreements.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Grievance intake:</strong> Collects and documents workplace issues</li>
      <li><strong>Contract interpretation:</strong> Applies local and divisional standards to day-to-day disputes</li>
      <li><strong>Employer interface:</strong> Engages directly with local management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Local committees operate within policy guidance established by TWU divisions and national leadership.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Divisional Committees: Industry Coordination</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Sector Divisions</strong> maintain committees responsible for aligning bargaining strategy,
      enforcement standards, and policy across an industry. These committees translate national objectives
      into sector-specific execution.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Strategy alignment:</strong> Coordinates bargaining goals and enforcement priorities</li>
      <li><strong>Precedent management:</strong> Promotes consistency in grievance handling across locals</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory expertise:</strong> Addresses industry-specific compliance and safety issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Divisional committees do not replace locals as bargaining agents; they ensure coordinated execution
      across similarly situated workforces.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Grievance Escalation and Arbitration</h2>
    <p>
      TWU contracts typically include structured grievance and arbitration procedures. While grievances
      originate at the local level, escalation is guided by divisional and national review to ensure
      strategic consistency and cost control.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local initiation:</strong> Grievances begin with workplace committees</li>
      <li><strong>Divisional review:</strong> Evaluates merits, precedent, and alignment with sector policy</li>
      <li><strong>Arbitration support:</strong> National resources assist with high-impact disputes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This layered approach balances immediacy with institutional coherence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Committees and Oversight</h2>
    <p>
      TWU maintains national committees and departments that provide legal, research, and strategic support.
      These bodies function as force multipliers rather than centralized administrators.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Legal and research support:</strong> Assists with arbitration, litigation, and policy analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Training and education:</strong> Develops committee and officer capacity</li>
      <li><strong>Policy governance:</strong> Ensures compliance with national standards</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Delegation, Oversight, and Control</h2>
    <p>
      TWU’s committee system reflects a deliberate balance between delegated execution and centralized control.
      Committees are empowered within defined scopes, while national authority retains corrective powers.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegated:</strong> Day-to-day enforcement and sector execution</li>
      <li><strong>Coordinated:</strong> Industry-wide alignment through divisions</li>
      <li><strong>Controlled:</strong> National oversight and constitutional enforcement</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Consistency across sectors:</strong> Divisional committees reduce fragmentation</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced local discretion:</strong> Enforcement is shaped by national and divisional standards</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional continuity:</strong> National oversight preserves precedent</li>
      <li><strong>Procedural rigor:</strong> Layered review increases consistency but adds complexity</li>
    </ul>
