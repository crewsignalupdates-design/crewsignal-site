    <h2>The Authority Problem TWU Is Designed to Solve</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong></strong> (TWU)
      represents workers across multiple transportation and industrial sectors with distinct regulatory,
      operational, and bargaining environments. Its governance architecture is therefore designed to
      ensure <em>national coherence</em> while enabling <em>industry-specific execution</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike decentralized local-autonomy models, TWU concentrates constitutional authority at the
      national level and deploys that authority through sector-based divisions rather than geographic
      federations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 1: Membership → Local Unions</h2>
    <p>
      Authority in TWU begins with the membership and is first exercised through <strong>Local Unions</strong>.
      Locals serve as the primary membership home and the point of contact for day-to-day workplace issues.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership affiliation:</strong> Members belong to a Local Union</li>
      <li><strong>Local governance:</strong> Local officers manage internal affairs and represent members</li>
      <li><strong>Operational role:</strong> Locals handle workplace-level enforcement and member services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While Locals play a critical operational role, their authority is not autonomous. It is exercised
      within the boundaries set by national rules and divisional policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 2: Local Unions → Sector Divisions</h2>
    <p>
      Above the local level, TWU organizes authority through <strong>Sector Divisions</strong>. Divisions
      align representation, bargaining strategy, and policy development across a specific industry,
      such as airlines or transit.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Industry alignment:</strong> Groups locals representing similar workforces</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining coordination:</strong> Aligns negotiation strategy and contract standards</li>
      <li><strong>Policy development:</strong> Addresses sector-specific regulatory and operational issues</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Divisions function as the primary execution layer for national strategy, translating constitutional
      authority into industry-relevant action.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 3: Divisions → National Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      At the top of the authority structure is <strong>National Leadership</strong>, which holds final
      constitutional authority over the union. National officers and governing bodies are responsible
      for maintaining institutional integrity and enforcing uniform standards.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Constitutional primacy:</strong> Final authority over interpretation and enforcement of union rules</li>
      <li><strong>Chartering and discipline:</strong> Authority to supervise, merge, or discipline subordinate bodies</li>
      <li><strong>Union-wide policy:</strong> Sets strategic direction across all sectors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      National authority in TWU is more centralized than in federated or local-autonomy models, serving
      as both a policy driver and a corrective backstop.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 4: Delegation vs. Central Control</h2>
    <p>
      TWU’s authority model is defined by the distinction between <em>delegated execution</em> and
      <em>retained control</em>. Operational tasks are delegated to locals and divisions, while
      constitutional power remains centralized.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Delegated:</strong> Workplace representation, sector bargaining, contract administration</li>
      <li><strong>Coordinated:</strong> Industry-wide strategy and standards through divisions</li>
      <li><strong>Retained:</strong> Constitutional interpretation, discipline, and final authority</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>National coherence:</strong> Policy and standards are uniform across sectors</li>
      <li><strong>Industry specialization:</strong> Divisions enable tailored execution</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced local autonomy:</strong> Locals operate within tighter national constraints</li>
      <li><strong>Clear authority termination:</strong> Final decision-making authority resides nationally</li>
    </ul>
