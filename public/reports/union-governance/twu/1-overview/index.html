  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong></strong> (TWU)
      is a multi-industry labor organization representing workers across transportation and related sectors,
      including airlines, transit, rail, utilities, and manufacturing. Unlike unions organized primarily
      around a single employer or a highly decentralized local-autonomy model, TWU operates through a
      <strong>national constitutional framework</strong> combined with sector-based divisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWU’s structure reflects an intentional balance between centralized authority and industry-specific
      representation. While members belong to local unions, strategic coordination and policy authority
      are exercised through national leadership and divisional governance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Historical Context and Sectoral Scope</h2>
    <p>
      TWU emerged from organizing efforts in urban transit and expanded over time into multiple transportation
      and industrial sectors. This expansion produced a governance model capable of supporting distinct
      industries with differing regulatory environments, bargaining structures, and operational demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, TWU’s representation spans:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Airline flight attendants, mechanics, and ground workers</li>
      <li>Public transit and rail employees</li>
      <li>Utility, manufacturing, and related transportation-adjacent sectors</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National–Divisional Union Model</h2>
    <p>
      TWU is organized around a <strong>national union with sector-based divisions</strong>. Authority is
      distributed vertically rather than geographically, with divisions serving as the primary mechanism
      for industry specialization.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local Unions:</strong> Membership home and workplace-level representation</li>
      <li><strong>Divisions:</strong> Industry-specific coordination, bargaining alignment, and policy development</li>
      <li><strong>National Leadership:</strong> Constitutional authority, chartering, and union-wide governance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This structure allows TWU to maintain consistency across the organization while adapting representation
      strategies to the realities of different industries.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Core Governance Principle</h2>
    <p>
      TWU’s governance framework is built around a central principle: <em>centralized constitutional authority
      combined with sector-specific execution</em>. While locals deliver day-to-day representation, divisions
      and national leadership shape bargaining strategy, policy, and institutional direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Local unions do not function as fully autonomous labor organizations</li>
      <li>Industry divisions play a central role in coordinating bargaining and representation</li>
      <li>National authority provides continuity, oversight, and discipline</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Characteristics</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Multi-sector scope:</strong> Representation spans distinct transportation industries</li>
      <li><strong>Divisional specialization:</strong> Industry alignment is prioritized over geographic autonomy</li>
      <li><strong>National coherence:</strong> Constitutional authority resides at the national level</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable governance:</strong> The model accommodates growth across sectors</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Analytical Significance</h2>
    <p>
      TWU occupies a distinct position among labor governance models. It is neither a single-carrier union
      nor a highly decentralized federation. Instead, it demonstrates how a national union can combine
      centralized authority with industry-specific execution to manage complexity at scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In subsequent reports, this series will examine how authority flows through TWU’s divisions, how
      representation is delivered, and how elections, committees, and financial systems operate within
      this national–divisional framework.
