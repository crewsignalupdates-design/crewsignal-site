    <h2>The Representation Pipeline</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong></strong> (TWU),
      representation is delivered through a vertically integrated model that separates <em>member interface</em>
      from <em>industry coordination</em> and <em>constitutional oversight</em>. Members experience representation
      primarily through their Local Unions, while divisions align strategy and policy across sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This design allows TWU to maintain national coherence while adapting representational practices to
      the operational realities of different transportation industries.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local Unions: Member Interface and Workplace Representation</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Unions</strong> are the primary point of contact between members and TWU. Locals administer
      membership affairs, handle workplace issues, and provide day-to-day representational services.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership services:</strong> Intake of grievances, questions, and workplace concerns</li>
      <li><strong>Workplace enforcement:</strong> Monitoring compliance with collective bargaining agreements</li>
      <li><strong>Employer interface:</strong> Direct engagement with management at the local level</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While Locals deliver representation directly, they do so within the strategic and policy frameworks
      established by TWU’s divisions and national leadership.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Sector Divisions: Industry-Specific Coordination</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Sector Divisions</strong> are the defining feature of TWU’s representation model. Divisions
      organize Locals representing similar industries—such as airlines or transit—into coordinated
      structures for bargaining, policy development, and strategic alignment.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Industry expertise:</strong> Develops sector-specific bargaining and enforcement strategies</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic coordination:</strong> Aligns locals facing similar employers or regulatory regimes</li>
      <li><strong>Policy translation:</strong> Adapts national priorities to industry-specific execution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Divisions do not replace Locals as bargaining agents; rather, they serve as the conduit through which
      national authority is operationalized at the industry level.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Support and Institutional Backing</h2>
    <p>
      TWU’s national organization provides legal, research, and strategic resources that reinforce
      representation across all divisions and locals. These resources enhance consistency and institutional
      continuity without centralizing day-to-day representation.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Legal and research support:</strong> Assists with arbitration, litigation, and policy analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic campaigns:</strong> Coordinates organizing and bargaining initiatives across sectors</li>
      <li><strong>Training and education:</strong> Builds leadership capacity within locals and divisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      National support functions act as force multipliers, strengthening local representation while preserving
      TWU’s centralized governance model.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Division of Representational Labor</h2>
    <p>
      TWU’s representation model deliberately separates functions across organizational levels:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local Unions:</strong> Member services, grievance handling, workplace enforcement</li>
      <li><strong>Sector Divisions:</strong> Industry coordination, bargaining alignment, policy development</li>
      <li><strong>National Leadership:</strong> Oversight, resources, constitutional enforcement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This division prioritizes consistency and scalability over local independence, distinguishing TWU
      from both federated lodge systems and decentralized local-autonomy models.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Consistent execution:</strong> Industry divisions reduce fragmentation across locals</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced local discretion:</strong> Representation is shaped by national and divisional standards</li>
      <li><strong>Sector adaptability:</strong> TWU can tailor strategies to distinct regulatory environments</li>
      <li><strong>Clear accountability paths:</strong> Authority flows upward through divisions to national leadership</li>
    </ul>
