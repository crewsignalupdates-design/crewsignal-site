  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Why Financial Governance Is Central in the TWU Model</h2>
    <p>
      In the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> (TWU),
      financial governance mirrors the union’s authority structure. While representation is delivered locally
      and coordinated through sector divisions, fiscal policy and oversight are anchored nationally to
      maintain consistency, solvency, and constitutional control.
    </p>
    <p>
      TWU’s financial system therefore emphasizes <em>centralized rules with delegated execution</em>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Dues as the Primary Revenue Source</h2>
    <p>
      TWU’s principal source of revenue is member dues. Dues are paid by members affiliated through Local
      Unions and distributed according to nationally defined formulas that support local operations,
      divisional coordination, and national governance.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership-funded:</strong> Operations are financed primarily through member dues</li>
      <li><strong>Standardized assessment:</strong> National rules govern dues structures and remittances</li>
      <li><strong>Predictable flow:</strong> Consistent formulas support budgeting across sectors</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Local and Divisional Financial Roles</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Local Unions</strong> and <strong>Sector Divisions</strong> exercise operational control over
      allocated funds. Locals finance workplace representation and member services, while divisions fund
      industry-wide coordination, bargaining alignment, and policy initiatives.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Local Unions:</strong> Fund grievance handling, contract enforcement, and member engagement</li>
      <li><strong>Sector Divisions:</strong> Finance bargaining coordination and industry-specific initiatives</li>
      <li><strong>Operational discretion:</strong> Spending authority exists within national policy limits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This arrangement enables sector responsiveness while preserving national fiscal discipline.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>National Financial Oversight and Control</h2>
    <p>
      While operational spending is distributed, financial control remains centralized. TWU’s national
      leadership establishes fiscal policy, reviews reporting, and retains corrective authority to
      address mismanagement or noncompliance.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Constitutional authority:</strong> Sets dues policy, remittance requirements, and reporting standards</li>
      <li><strong>Audit and review:</strong> Subordinate bodies are subject to financial oversight</li>
      <li><strong>Corrective intervention:</strong> National leadership may intervene when necessary</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Strike Funds, Reserves, and Risk Management</h2>
    <p>
      TWU maintains reserves and strike funds to support members during labor disputes and to protect
      organizational continuity. These funds function as strategic assets rather than routine operating
      accounts.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Collective risk pooling:</strong> Reserves distribute risk across the membership</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining leverage:</strong> Financial preparedness strengthens negotiating posture</li>
      <li><strong>Continuity planning:</strong> Protects core functions during disruptions</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Transparency and Internal Accountability</h2>
    <p>
      Financial accountability within TWU is enforced through elected officers, structured reporting,
      and national oversight rather than direct, union-wide review of all expenditures.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Elected stewardship:</strong> Financial officers are accountable through electoral processes</li>
      <li><strong>Structured reporting:</strong> Regular disclosures support internal review</li>
      <li><strong>Disciplinary backstop:</strong> Mismanagement can trigger national corrective action</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>National coherence:</strong> Central rules promote consistency across sectors</li>
      <li><strong>Delegated execution:</strong> Locals and divisions retain operational flexibility</li>
      <li><strong>Layered accountability:</strong> Financial transparency is mediated through organizational levels</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional stability:</strong> Oversight and reserves protect long-term viability</li>
    </ul>

<section class="cs-report__section" id="lm-2-disclosures">
  <h2 class="cs-report__section-title">Statutory Financial Disclosure (LM-2)</h2>

  <p class="cs-report__body">
    The U.S. Department of Labor requires many labor organizations to file annual financial disclosure
    reports under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). LM-2 filings provide a
    standardized view of revenue sources, disbursement categories, officer compensation, and major
    spending categories.
