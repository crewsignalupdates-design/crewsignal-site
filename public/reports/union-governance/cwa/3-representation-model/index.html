      <h2>Representation Framework</h2>
      <p>
        CWA delivers member representation through a decentralized structure of locals,
        districts, councils, and sector-specific affiliates. Unlike single-carrier unions,
        representation is not organized around standardized bases or domiciles, but rather
        around employer groupings, geographic jurisdictions, or industry sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        This framework reflects CWA’s multi-employer and multi-industry composition and
        requires representation capacity to be scaled across heterogeneous bargaining units.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Local and District-Level Representation</h2>
      <p>
        Day-to-day member representation is primarily handled at the local or district level.
        Local officers and representatives are responsible for grievance handling, contract
        interpretation, and member assistance within their jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        District structures provide coordination, training, and escalation pathways for
        locals, particularly in complex disputes or multi-employer environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Sector and Affiliate Representation</h2>
      <p>
        In certain industries, including aviation, representation is conducted through
        sector-specific affiliates operating under CWA charters. These affiliates focus on
        industry-specific regulatory environments, bargaining norms, and operational needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sector-level entities do not operate independently of the national union; their
        authority, staffing, and financial resources are derived from and constrained by
        national governance structures.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Member Services and Coverage Scaling</h2>
      <p>
        Member services include grievance representation, disciplinary defense, contract
        enforcement, workplace advocacy, and access to union resources. Coverage levels vary
        based on local capacity, staffing, and the complexity of the bargaining unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scaling of representation is achieved through pooled resources, regional coordination,
        and national support functions, rather than through a uniform base staffing model.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>National Support Functions</h2>
      <p>
        The national union provides legal support, research, communications, and strategic
        coordination to subordinate bodies. These functions supplement local representation
        but do not replace local responsibility for member engagement and issue resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        National involvement increases in disputes with broader legal, political, or
        precedent-setting implications.

      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Representation quality varies by local capacity and sector complexity</li>
        <li>Members interact primarily with local or sector-level representatives</li>
        <li>National coordination enhances consistency but centralizes expertise</li>
        <li>The absence of a standardized base model increases reliance on local governance</li>
