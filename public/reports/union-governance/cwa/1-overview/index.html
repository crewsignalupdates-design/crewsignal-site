    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is a national labor organization representing workers across multiple industries,
        including telecommunications, media, manufacturing, public service, and aviation. It operates as a parent union composed of
        numerous subordinate entities rather than as a single-carrier or single-industry union.
      </p>
      <p>
        CWA’s governance framework is designed to support this multi-sector structure by centralizing constitutional authority at the
        national level while delegating limited operational functions to districts, locals, councils, and sector-specific affiliates.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Origins and Organizational Form</h2>
      <p>
        CWA was formed through the consolidation of multiple communications-sector labor organizations and has evolved into a
        union-of-unions model. This structure allows the organization to represent a wide range of bargaining units with differing
        employers, bargaining scopes, and legal environments under a single national constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike single-carrier unions, CWA does not operate on a unified base or domicile system. Instead, representation is organized
        through a layered structure of subordinate bodies chartered by the national union.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Independence and Affiliation</h2>
      <p>
        CWA functions as an independent national labor organization for purposes of governance, finance, and statutory reporting.
        Subordinate entities operate under charters granted by the national union and do not possess independent constitutional sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sector-specific affiliates, including aviation-focused organizations, derive their authority from the national union and are subject
        to national constitutional provisions governing finance, elections, discipline, and internal administration.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Baseline Governance Model</h2>
      <p>
        CWA’s baseline governance model is characterized by:
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Centralized constitutional authority</strong> at the national level</li>
        <li><strong>Derivative authority</strong> exercised by subordinate bodies</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-employer and multi-sector representation</strong>, rather than a single-carrier model</li>
        <li><strong>Delegate-based national decision-making</strong>, rather than direct national membership voting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This framework prioritizes coordination, consistency, and institutional continuity across diverse bargaining environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <p>
        CWA’s organizational form establishes a clear hierarchy of authority and responsibility. National leadership retains primary control
        over constitutional interpretation, financial governance, and strategic coordination, while subordinate entities function within defined
        limits to administer representation and member services at the local or sector level.
      </p>
      <p>
        This structural baseline informs all subsequent aspects of governance, including authority flow, representation delivery, elections,
        committee functions, and financial control.
