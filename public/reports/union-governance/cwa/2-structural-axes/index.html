      How authority is distributed, exercised, and constrained inside a union-of-unions governance model.

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>The Core Design</h2>
    <p>
      The Communications Workers of America (CWA) is structurally distinct from most U.S. labor unions.
      It is not a single, vertically integrated organization, but a <em>union of unions</em>:
      a parent organization that charters and governs subordinate bodies operating across industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      This design produces a governance architecture with multiple, overlapping authority pathways.
      Authority does not flow along a single hierarchical chain. Instead, it is distributed across
      two primary and constitutionally significant axes: <strong>geographic districts</strong> and
      <strong>industrial sectors</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 1: Membership, Convention, and Constitutional Authority</h2>
    <p>
      At the highest level, CWA’s ultimate authority originates in its Constitution and Convention.
      Delegates to the CWA Convention exercise sovereign authority to amend governing documents,
      elect national officers, and establish binding policy direction for the organization.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Membership:</strong> The source of representational legitimacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Convention delegates:</strong> Exercise constitutional authority on behalf of the membership.</li>
      <li><strong>Constitution:</strong> Defines the scope, limits, and delegation of power throughout the union.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This convention-centered authority model is characteristic of large parent unions, but in CWA
      it interacts in unusually complex ways with subordinate governance structures.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 2: Geographic District Authority</h2>
    <p>
      CWA is divided into geographic districts, each of which plays a formal role in governance,
      administration, and representation. Districts are not merely service regions; they are
      governance units with defined responsibilities under the Constitution.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Districts:</strong> Coordinate locals within a geographic area.</li>
      <li><strong>District leadership:</strong> Exercises administrative and political authority.</li>
      <li><strong>Convention role:</strong> Districts influence delegate composition and voting dynamics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      District authority introduces a geographic dimension to governance that can operate
      independently of industrial or occupational alignment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Axis 3: Industrial Sector Authority</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to geographic districts, CWA charters industrial sectors that represent workers
      across specific industries or occupations. These sectors often maintain distinct leadership
      structures, internal governance rules, and operational autonomy.
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Sectors:</strong> Organize representation by industry rather than geography.</li>
      <li><strong>Chartered authority:</strong> Derived from, but subordinate to, the CWA Constitution.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational autonomy:</strong> Varies by sector and by constitutional grant.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The coexistence of sector-based and district-based authority is a defining feature of CWA
      and is not replicated in most other large U.S. labor unions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Authority Overlap and Constraint</h2>
    <p>
      Because districts and sectors operate simultaneously, authority within CWA often overlaps.
      This can produce ambiguity regarding which body has final decision-making power over
      representation, resources, and strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While sectors may exercise day-to-day operational control, constitutional authority remains
      centralized at the CWA level. Districts may influence administration and politics, but they
      do not supersede the parent union’s constitutional supremacy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li><strong>Dual authority axes:</strong> Governance operates across districts and sectors simultaneously.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-linear control:</strong> Authority does not follow a single vertical chain.</li>
      <li><strong>Accountability complexity:</strong> Responsibility for outcomes may be diffuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial opacity risk:</strong> Multiple governing entities complicate tracking of dues usage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These structural characteristics directly shape how CWA must be evaluated in financial
      disclosures, including LM-2 filings.
