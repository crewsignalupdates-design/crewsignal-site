    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        CWAâ€“Association of Flight Attendants (CWA-AFA) is a sector-level labor organization
        representing flight attendants across multiple air carriers. It operates as a
        subordinate affiliate within the Communications Workers of America (CWA) rather than
        as an independent national union.
      </p>
      <p>
        CWA-AFAâ€™s governance framework reflects this subordinate status, combining sector-
        specific representation functions with constitutional, financial, and administrative
        authority retained by the CWA parent union.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Origins and Organizational Form</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA was formed to provide industry-specific representation for flight attendants
        within the broader CWA organizational structure. Its creation reflects CWAâ€™s strategy
        of organizing distinct industries through sector-focused affiliates rather than
        independent, single-industry unions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike standalone flight attendant unions, CWA-AFA does not possess an independent
        constitution. Its authority and existence are derived from charters and governance
        provisions established by the CWA national union.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Affiliation and Subordinate Status</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA operates under the authority of the CWA Constitution and is subject to national
        governance rules governing finance, elections, discipline, and internal administration.
        It does not function as a legally or constitutionally autonomous labor organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sector-level leadership, councils, and committees exercise authority delegated by the
        parent union, rather than authority originating independently from the membership.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Baseline Governance Model</h2>
      <p>
        The baseline governance model of CWA-AFA is characterized by:
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Derivative authority</strong> exercised under CWA constitutional control</li>
        <li><strong>Sector-level representation</strong> organized by carrier and base</li>
        <li><strong>Centralized financial and administrative oversight</strong> by the parent union</li>
        <li><strong>Limited independent governance capacity</strong> at the affiliate level</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This model distinguishes CWA-AFA from independent flight attendant unions while enabling
        coordinated bargaining and representation across multiple carriers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFAâ€™s subordinate structure establishes clear limits on sector-level autonomy while
        providing access to national resources, legal infrastructure, and financial support
        controlled by the parent union.
      </p>
      <p>
        These structural characteristics shape authority flow, representation delivery, member
        control mechanisms, and financial governance across all subsequent aspects of CWA-AFA
        operations.
