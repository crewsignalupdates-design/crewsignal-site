      <h2>Election System Overview</h2>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA operates as a sector-level organization within the Communications Workers of America (CWA) structure.
        Election rules and member-control mechanisms reflect this arrangement: sector and carrier-level elections operate
        within constraints set by the parent unionâ€™s constitutional framework and administrative requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Member control is exercised most directly at the carrier and base representation layer, and more indirectly where
        authority is reserved to the parent union or to sector-level bodies operating under CWA oversight.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Eligibility and Candidacy</h2>
      <p>
        Eligibility to vote and run for office is governed by applicable bylaws and rules at the relevant level of
        organization (sector, carrier council, base, or committee election where applicable). Requirements typically
        include membership status, standing, and any office-specific criteria.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Voter eligibility:</strong> membership status and standing at the applicable carrier/sector level.</li>
        <li><strong>Candidate eligibility:</strong> defined for each office or representative position; may include standing and service requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope:</strong> eligibility rules may differ by carrier council or representative tier, subject to sector-level governance constraints.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Balloting and Vote Administration</h2>
      <p>
        Elections are administered at the level where representation is operationally delivered (carrier/base structures),
        with sector-level oversight where required. Administration includes nominations, ballot distribution, vote tabulation,
        and required notices and timelines.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Nominations:</strong> conducted through defined procedures and timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Balloting:</strong> member voting processes vary by council or representative tier.</li>
        <li><strong>Administration:</strong> election handling is performed by responsible bodies operating under sector and parent-union compliance expectations.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Certification and Internal Remedies</h2>
      <p>
        Election results are certified pursuant to the rules governing the applicable election. Challenges are addressed
        through internal protest and appeal mechanisms before escalation to external statutory remedies.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Certification:</strong> formal confirmation of results by the responsible authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Protests and challenges:</strong> handled through internal procedures and adjudicatory channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeals:</strong> escalation pathways may involve sector-level bodies and, where applicable, parent-union review.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Member Control Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>
        Member control is exercised through elections for representative positions, participation in carrier and base governance,
        ratification votes on negotiated agreements, and internal accountability processes. Where authority is centralized or reserved
        at the parent-union level, member influence is indirect and mediated through the sectorâ€™s governance pathways.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Direct participation:</strong> strongest at the carrier/base representation layer.</li>
        <li><strong>Indirect participation:</strong> sector-level outcomes influenced through representative selection and internal processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> internal remedies, procedural safeguards, and compliance constraints.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Member control is operationally strongest where representation is delivered (carrier/base leadership).</li>
        <li>Election administration and remedies operate within sector-level governance and parent-union compliance expectations.</li>
        <li>Where authority is reserved to the parent union, member influence is indirect and routed through internal processes.</li>
        <li>Transparent procedures and predictable internal remedies are critical for legitimacy in a subordinate governance model.</li>
      </ul>
