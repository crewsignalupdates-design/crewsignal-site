      <h2>Authority Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Authority within CWA-AFA is not autonomous. It is exercised pursuant to powers delegated
        by the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and is constrained by the CWA Constitution,
        national governance bodies, and parent-union administrative control.
      </p>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA functions as an operational and representational layer rather than as an
        independent source of constitutional authority.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Origination of Authority</h2>
      <p>
        Formal authority originates at the CWA national level. Constitutional authority is
        vested in the CWA membership collectively and exercised through national conventions,
        elected national officers, and the CWA Executive Board.
      </p>
      <p>
        CWA-AFA leadership positions, councils, and committees derive authority through charter
        and delegation rather than direct constitutional grant from the flight attendant
        membership.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Flow of Authority</h2>
      <p>
        Authority flows downward from the CWA national structure to sector-level bodies such as
        CWA-AFA, and further to carrier councils, base representatives, and committee structures.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>National level:</strong> constitutional interpretation, financial control, and ultimate governance authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Sector level:</strong> delegated authority for industry-specific representation and coordination.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrier and base level:</strong> operational representation within defined limits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Delegated authority may be modified, withdrawn, or overridden by the parent union in
        accordance with constitutional and administrative provisions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Termination and Override Authority</h2>
      <p>
        Final decision-making authority resides with the CWA national union. The CWA Executive
        Board and national officers retain the ability to override sector-level decisions,
        impose administrative control, or resolve disputes affecting governance, finance, or
        compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sector-level decisions do not constitute final authority where they conflict with
        national policy, constitutional interpretation, or statutory compliance requirements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Member Influence and Control Points</h2>
      <p>
        Flight attendants affiliated with CWA-AFA exercise influence primarily through local
        participation, carrier councils, and sector-level representation mechanisms. Direct
        control over national authority structures is indirect and mediated through the parent
        unionâ€™s governance processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critical control points include delegate selection, internal appeals, and participation
        in sector-level governance bodies operating under CWA oversight.
      </p>

      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Sector-level authority is derivative rather than sovereign.</li>
        <li>Ultimate governance control resides with the parent union.</li>
        <li>Operational autonomy exists within defined and revocable limits.</li>
        <li>Member influence is strongest at the local and carrier level.</li>
