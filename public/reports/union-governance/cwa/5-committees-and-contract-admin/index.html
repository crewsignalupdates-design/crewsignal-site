      <h2>Committee Framework</h2>
      <p>
        CWA utilizes a combination of standing and ad hoc committees to support governance,
        bargaining coordination, policy development, and internal administration. Committees
        may be established by constitutional provision, Executive Board action, or convention
        resolution, depending on their scope and function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Committee authority is generally advisory unless explicitly delegated decision-making
        power by the national union or governing body.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Bargaining Committees</h2>
      <p>
        Collective bargaining is conducted at the sector, employer, or bargaining-unit level,
        with bargaining committees formed to represent members in negotiations. These committees
        operate within strategic parameters established by national or sector leadership.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> representatives drawn from affected units or sectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> national guidance on strategy, messaging, and legal posture.</li>
        <li><strong>Approval:</strong> tentative agreements subject to ratification procedures.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>National Coordination and Oversight</h2>
      <p>
        The national union provides coordination across bargaining units to ensure consistency
        with broader organizational goals, legal compliance, and resource allocation. National
        staff and officers may participate directly in negotiations for major contracts or
        disputes with sector-wide implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This coordination function centralizes expertise while limiting unilateral bargaining
        autonomy at subordinate levels.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Contract Administration</h2>
      <p>
        Contract administration responsibilities include grievance handling, contract
        interpretation, arbitration, and enforcement. These functions are typically performed
        at the local or sector level, with escalation pathways to district or national bodies
        for complex or precedent-setting matters.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Grievances:</strong> initiated and processed at the local or unit level.</li>
        <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> pursued in accordance with contract provisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal support:</strong> provided by national resources when required.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Member Involvement and Ratification</h2>
      <p>
        Members participate in contract outcomes primarily through ratification votes on
        negotiated agreements. Ratification procedures vary by sector or bargaining unit and
        are governed by applicable bylaws or constitutional provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Committee members and local leadership serve as the primary conduit between negotiators
        and the membership during bargaining and administration phases.
      </p>

      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>Bargaining authority is exercised locally but shaped by national coordination.</li>
        <li>Committees function primarily as advisory and representational bodies.</li>
        <li>Contract enforcement depends on local capacity with national escalation pathways.</li>
        <li>Centralized expertise enhances consistency while constraining local autonomy.</li>
