    <h2>Dues Structure Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Members of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) fund the union’s activities through regular dues
      assessments. Dues are generally established at the national level, with additional assessments determined
      by sectoral, district, or local structures depending on the bargaining unit and affiliate arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dues revenue supports the union’s core representational, administrative, and operational functions across its
      national and subordinate bodies.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Allocation of Dues Revenue</h2>
    <p>
      Dues collected by CWA are allocated across a range of functions, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Collective bargaining and contract administration</li>
      <li>Representation in grievances, arbitration, and related proceedings</li>
      <li>Organizing and membership development</li>
      <li>Administrative operations and staffing</li>
      <li>Legal, professional, and consulting services</li>
      <li>Transfers and per-capita payments to affiliates and subordinate bodies, where applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The specific distribution of dues revenue varies by year and is reflected in the union’s federally filed financial reports.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>Financial Transparency and Reporting</h2>
    <p>
      As a labor organization subject to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), CWA is required
      to file annual financial disclosures with the U.S. Department of Labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      These filings are intended to provide transparency into the union’s finances, including revenues, expenditures,
      assets, liabilities, and payments to officers and outside entities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cs-report__section">
    <h2>LM-2 Financial Disclosures</h2>
    <p>
      CWA files <strong>Form LM-2</strong>, the most detailed financial disclosure required under the LMRDA. LM-2 reports
      provide comprehensive information, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="cs-report__list">
      <li>Total dues revenue and other income</li>
      <li>Disbursements by functional category</li>
      <li>Officer salaries and other compensation</li>
      <li>Political activities and lobbying expenditures</li>
      <li>Legal and professional fees</li>
      <li>Transfers to affiliates and subordinate bodies</li>
      <li>Assets, liabilities, and reserves</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      LM-2 filings serve as the primary source for analyzing union finances on a standardized and comparable basis.
