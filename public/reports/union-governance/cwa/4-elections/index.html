      <h2>Election System Overview</h2>
      <p>
        CWA’s national governance operates primarily through a delegate-based convention system. National officers are elected
        through constitutionally defined convention procedures rather than direct rank-and-file balloting at the national level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Member voting power is exercised most directly through local and district elections, and indirectly through the selection
        of delegates who participate in national convention decisions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Eligibility and Candidacy</h2>
      <p>
        Eligibility to vote, run for office, and serve as a delegate is governed by constitutional and subordinate-body rules,
        including standing, membership status, and any specified eligibility requirements tied to office or delegate roles.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Voter eligibility:</strong> defined at the applicable governance level (local, district, or national convention).</li>
        <li><strong>Candidate eligibility:</strong> conditioned on membership standing and any office-specific requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegate eligibility:</strong> determined by subordinate selection processes and apportionment rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Balloting and Vote Administration</h2>
      <p>
        Election administration is conducted at the level where the election occurs. Local and district elections are administered
        by subordinate entities under constitutional and statutory requirements. National officer elections occur through convention
        voting processes.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Direct elections:</strong> members vote directly in local and district elections.</li>
        <li><strong>Convention elections:</strong> delegates vote for national leadership positions.</li>
        <li><strong>Apportionment:</strong> delegate voting strength is typically linked to membership size.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Certification and Internal Remedies</h2>
      <p>
        Election results are certified pursuant to the applicable rules governing the election level. Disputes, challenges, and
        election-related grievances are typically addressed through internal protest and appeal mechanisms before escalation to
        external statutory remedies.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Certification:</strong> formal confirmation of results by the responsible body or election authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Protests and challenges:</strong> addressed through internal procedures and adjudicatory bodies.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeals:</strong> escalated through defined governance channels, up to national bodies where applicable.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Member Control Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>
        Member control is exercised through a combination of direct elections at subordinate levels, delegate representation at
        the national level, constitutional amendment mechanisms, and internal accountability processes.
      </p>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li><strong>Direct participation:</strong> strongest at the local and unit level.</li>
        <li><strong>Indirect participation:</strong> national governance mediated through delegates.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> internal remedies, disciplinary systems, and constitutional constraints.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="cs-report__section">
      <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
      <ul class="cs-report__list">
        <li>National leadership selection is structurally indirect for rank-and-file members.</li>
        <li>Delegate selection is the critical control point for national governance outcomes.</li>
        <li>Local election integrity and member participation drive practical democratic control.</li>
        <li>Internal protest and appeal mechanisms function as the primary dispute-resolution layer.</li>
      </ul>
