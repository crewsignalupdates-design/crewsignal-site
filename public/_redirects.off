# =========================================
#  CrewSignal.org Redirect & Security Rules
#  Safe base version – no redirect loops
# =========================================

# --- Canonical Host Enforcement ---
# Force HTTPS and route all "www" or "http" to https://crewsignal.org
http://crewsignal.org/*        https://crewsignal.org/:splat   301!
http://www.crewsignal.org/*    https://crewsignal.org/:splat   301!
https://www.crewsignal.org/*   https://crewsignal.org/:splat   301!

# --- SPA / Static File Fallback ---
# If using a Single Page App (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.), uncomment next line:
# /*  /index.html  200

# =========================================
#  Optional: Security Headers (can live in netlify.toml instead)
#  These do not affect redirects or loops.
# =========================================
#  NOTE: Header rules only work in netlify.toml, not in this _redirects file.
#  Keep them in netlify.toml’s [[headers]] section, for example:
#
# [[headers]]
#   for = "/*"
#   [headers.values]
#     Strict-Transport-Security = "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
#     Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; upgrade-insecure-requests"
#     X-Frame-Options = "SAMEORIGIN"
#     Referrer-Policy = "no-referrer-when-downgrade"
#     Permissions-Policy = "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()"
