      <h1>Merger vs. Integration: What Structures Mean for Crews</h1>
      <p>
        To investors, a “merger” or “integration” can sound like buzzwords on a slide.
        To crews under the Railway Labor Act, those words translate into concrete questions
        about seniority, bases, pay, and job security.

      Crew-level takeaway: you don’t need to predict whether any specific deal will close.
      You do need to understand what kind of structure is on the table and what that
      structure implies for your list, your base, and your leverage.
    </div>

    <h2 id="term-merger">Merger</h2>
    <p>
      In the classic sense, a <strong>merger</strong> is a statutory combination of two
      corporations into one. One entity survives; the other is folded into it. Assets,
      liabilities, and contracts are consolidated into a single corporate shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In airline practice, a merger usually aligns with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A clear “surviving carrier” identity;</li>
      <li>Regulatory approvals from DOJ, DOT, and others;</li>
      <li>A path to a <a href="#term-single-carrier">single-carrier</a> finding at the
          <a href="https://www.nmb.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NMB</a>;</li>
      <li>A formal process for <a href="#term-seniority">seniority integration</a> and
          eventual <a href="#term-jcba">JCBA</a> bargaining.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="term-integration">Integration</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Integration</strong> is a looser term. Management may talk about “integrating”
      schedules, revenue management, brands, or networks long before there is a single legal
      merger or a single certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Integration language can include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deep codeshares and aligned schedules;</li>
      <li>Shared branding, liveries, and marketing;</li>
      <li>Common management teams and joint planning;</li>
      <li>Transfers of flying between entities under common control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For crews, integration without a clear merger plan can feel like
      “merger consequences first, labor clarity later.”
    </p>

    <h2 id="term-single-carrier">Single-carrier (NMB)</h2>
    <p>
      Under the Railway Labor Act, the NMB decides when two or more carriers have become
      a <strong>single transportation system</strong> for representation purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Board looks at factors such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Common management and control of labor relations;</li>
      <li>Integrated operations (dispatch, scheduling, maintenance control);</li>
      <li>Branding and public presentation as “one airline”;</li>
      <li>Financial and operational interdependence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="term-jcba">Joint collective bargaining agreement (JCBA)</h2>
    <p>
      A JCBA is the contract that governs the combined group of employees after a merger
      or single-carrier finding. Negotiating a JCBA is often the last major step in
      “completing” a merger from the crew perspective.
    </p>

    <h2 id="term-seniority">Seniority integration</h2>
    <p>
      Seniority integration combines two or more seniority lists into one. For pilots,
      flight attendants, and other crafts, seniority determines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Base placement and equipment;</li>
      <li>Monthly schedule quality;</li>
      <li>Upgrade timing and long-term earnings;</li>
      <li>Exposure during downsizing or volatility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="term-fences">Fences</h2>
    <p>
      Fences are temporary rules that limit the movement of flying, bases, or equipment
      between pre-merger groups until all labor integration steps are complete.
    </p>

    <h2 id="term-scope">Scope</h2>
    <p>
      Scope clauses define what flying must be done by the bargaining unit. In integration
      or merger scenarios, scope can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Protect flying from being outsourced or shifted to affiliates;</li>
      <li>Or, if weak, allow flying to migrate outside the mainline list.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="term-structures">Transaction structures</h2>
    <p>
      Deal architects mix and match features to balance regulatory risk, tax structures,
      balance sheets, and labor dynamics. Common structures include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full statutory merger</strong>;</li>
      <li><strong>Holding company structures</strong> with multiple certificates;</li>
      <li><strong>Asset transfers</strong> (gates, slots, aircraft);</li>
      <li><strong>Joint ventures</strong> that function like mergers in practice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quick checklist for crews</h2>
    <p>When a new deal or “strategic partnership” is announced, crews can quickly assess:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is this a merger, an integration, or something in between?</li>
      <li>What is the likely timing for an NMB single-carrier finding?</li>
      <li>How will seniority lists be integrated?</li>
      <li>What fences protect bases and flying during transitions?</li>
      <li>Does scope adequately cover the structure being proposed?</li>
    </ul>
